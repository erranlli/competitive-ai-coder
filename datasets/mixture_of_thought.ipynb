For n=4: reverse sorted is 4,3,2,1. Rotating once gives 3,2,1,4. Check the condition. 3+2=5 !=1, then 2+1=3 !=4. So valid. Then another rotation: 2,1,4,3. Check: 2+1=3 !=4, 1+4=5 !=3. Valid. Then another rotation:1,4,3,2. 1+4=5 !=3, 4+3=7 !=2. Valid. But for n=4, we need 4 permutations, and with rotations, we can generate 4. So perhaps this approach works.\n",

      "\n",
      "Ah, right. So this approach may not work for all n. For example, when n=3, the rotated array would have 2 1 3, which has 2+1=3. So that permutation is invalid. So the rotation approach works for n=4 but not for n=3.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the rotation idea is not sufficient. Need another approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm. So perhaps the key is to find a way to generate n permutations for each n. Let's think of a way to generate permutations that start with the same first two elements. For example, if the first two elements are fixed, and the remaining elements are arranged in a way that doesn't create any sum triplet.\n",

Then for the fourth element, it can't be the sum of the second and third, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "But constructing such permutations step by step is possible but computationally intensive. However, given that n is up to 50 and t is 48, and for each test case we need to generate n permutations, perhaps we can precompute all possible permutations for n up to 50. But that's impossible. So a smarter way is needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's think about the case where n is even. Maybe arrange the elements in a way that alternates between high and low numbers. For example, 4,1,3,2. Then 1,4,2,3. But how to ensure that the sum conditions are met.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another approach: for each permutation, arrange the elements such that all consecutive triplets are either in strictly decreasing order or have the third element not equal to the sum. For example, in a permutation where every third element is placed such that it's less than the sum of the previous two. Since in a permutation, the sum of two elements can be as high as (n + (n-1)), and the next elements are smaller than or equal to n. Wait, but for the reverse sorted list, the sum of any two previous elements is larger than the next element, so the third element can't be the sum. So this is safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the reverse sorted list is a valid permutation. Then, perhaps any permutation that starts with a large number followed by another large number, then the rest in reverse order. Wait, maybe a way to generate multiple permutations is to take the reverse sorted array and then generate permutations by shifting the first element to the end, but that's what the rotation approach does.

Hmm, anti-Fibonacci means that for every position i ≥3, the sum of the previous two elements is not equal to the current element. So each permutation must avoid any triplet where the third element is the sum of the first two. \\n\\nLet me think about possible approaches. The constraints are n up to 50, and t up to 48. But for each test case, we need to generate n different permutations. For n=50, that's 50 permutations of 50 elements. That's a lot, but since the time limit is 2 seconds, we need an efficient way to generate them.\\n\\nFirst, I need to find a way to generate permutations that satisfy the anti-Fibonacci condition. But generating all possible permutations and checking each for the condition is impossible for n=50, as 50! is way too big. So we need a smarter approach.\\n\\nWait, the problem says that it's possible to find n such permutations. So maybe there's a pattern or a construction method that can generate these permutations quickly.\\n\\nLet's look at the examples. For n=3, the sample output is three permutations. Let's see:\\n\\nSample input 3:\\nThey output:\\n3 2 1\\n1 3 2\\n3 1 2\\n\\nWait, the first permutation is [3,2,1]. Check the condition. For i=3, the sum of first two elements is 3+2=5, but third element is 1. So 5 !=1, which is okay. So this permutation is valid.\\n\\nThe second permutation is [1,3,2]. Check for i=3: 1+3=4 !=2. So valid.\\n\\nThird permutation [3,1,2]: 3+1=4 !=2. Also valid.\\n\\nSo the key is to arrange the elements such that no three consecutive elements form a Fibonacci-like triplet (where the third is the sum of the first two). \\n\\nHmm. How can we construct such permutations? Maybe arrange them in a way that avoids any consecutive triplets summing to the third. \\n\\nOne possible approach is to generate permutations where each element is arranged in such a way that each triplet after the first two elements does not have p_i = p_{i-1} + p_{i-2}.\\n\\nWait, but how to ensure that for all triplets in the permutation.\\n\\nMaybe a greedy approach. Start by creating a permutation where the elements are arranged in a way that this condition is satisfied.\\n\\nAnother idea: for a permutation, arrange it in a way that each element is either increasing or decreasing, but perhaps with some shifts. For example, a permutation that is sorted in reverse order (like descending) would likely not have any triplet where the third element is the sum of the first two, since all elements are decreasing. Let's see: take n=4. Reverse order is 4,3,2,1. Check:\\n\\n4+3 =7 !=2. 3+2=5 !=1. So that permutation is valid. So that's one permutation. But then for the next permutations, maybe we can generate permutations by rotating or swapping elements in some way that maintains the condition.\\n\\nBut how to generate n distinct permutations. For example, in the sample input for n=4, the first permutation is 4 1 3 2. Let's check: positions 3:4+1=5 !=3. positions 4:1+3=4 !=2. So that's valid. \\n\\nAnother approach is to generate a set of permutations by starting with a base permutation and then creating variations that don't violate the condition. For example, arranging the elements in a way that adjacent elements are swapped but in a way that avoids the sum condition.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps a simple pattern can be used. For example, arrange the elements in a way that alternates between high and low values. For instance, place the largest elements and smallest elements alternately. Like for n=4: 4,1,3,2. Then, another permutation could be 3,4,1,2. These may avoid the sum condition.\\n\\nWait, perhaps the key is to create permutations where for any three consecutive elements, the third is not the sum of the previous two. So how to ensure that?\\n\\nLet's think of a permutation where the elements are arranged such that each next element is either higher or lower than the previous elements in a way that the sum cannot equal the next element. For instance, in a sorted order (ascending), the sum of the first two elements is 1+2=3, which is exactly the third element. So that's invalid. So sorted order is bad. Similarly for sorted in reverse order, the first three elements are 3,2,1. Sum is 5, which is not equal to 1. So that's okay. So reverse sorted order is a valid permutation.\\n\\nSo for the first permutation, we can output the reverse sorted list. Now, for the next permutations, perhaps we can swap elements in a way that doesn't create any triplet where p_i = p_{i-1} + p_{i-2}.\\n\\nAnother idea: For each permutation, arrange the elements such that after the first two elements, every next element is smaller than the sum of the previous two. Since the sum is at least 3 (for the first two elements being 1 and 2), but in a permutation, the elements are unique. Wait, but maybe if the elements are arranged in a way where each element is not the sum of the previous two. \\n\\nBut how to generate multiple such permutations.\\n\\nWait, here's a possible pattern. Let's take n=4. The reverse sorted permutation is 4 3 2 1. This is valid. Now, another permutation can be generated by swapping the last two elements: 4 3 1 2. Wait, check: 4+3=7 !=1, then 3+1=4 !=2. So valid. Then another permutation could be 4 2 3 1. Check sum conditions: 4+2=6 !=3, 2+3=5 !=1. So valid. But generating these permutations manually for each n up to 50 is not feasible.\\n\\nAlternative approach: For each permutation, ensure that after the first two elements, each subsequent element is not the sum of the previous two. How can we construct such permutations?\\n\\nLet's think about the reverse sorted list. For reverse sorted list, each element is smaller than the previous. So for any i ≥3, p_i-2 + p_i-1 will be greater than p_i (since p_i-2 and p_i-1 are both larger than p_i, their sum is larger). So in this case, p_i can't be the sum. So reverse sorted permutation is valid.\\n\\nSo the first permutation can be the reverse sorted list. For example, for n=4: 4,3,2,1. Then, the next permutations can be generated by permuting the elements in some way that doesn't create any triplet that violates the condition.\\n\\nBut how to generate multiple such permutations. For example, for n=3, there are 6 possible permutations, but we need to output 3 of them. The sample shows that.\\n\\nAnother idea: For the first permutation, use the reverse sorted list. Then, generate permutations by rotating the elements. For example, rotating the reverse sorted list. For n=4: reverse sorted is 4,3,2,1. Rotating once gives 3,2,1,4. Check the condition. 3+2=5 !=1, then 2+1=3 !=4. So valid. Then another rotation: 2,1,4,3. Check: 2+1=3 !=4, 1+4=5 !=3. Valid. Then another rotation:1,4,3,2. 1+4=5 !=3, 4+3=7 !=2. Valid. But for n=4, we need 4 permutations, and with rotations, we can generate 4. So perhaps this approach works.\\n\\nWait, for n=4, rotating the reverse sorted array four times would cycle back. So each rotation gives a new permutation. But we can take n such rotations. For example, for the reverse sorted array, the rotations would give n permutations. Let's check:\\n\\nOriginal reverse: 4 3 2 1 → valid.\\n\\nRotate once (shift left by 1): 3 2 1 4 → valid.\\n\\nRotate again: 2 1 4 3 → valid.\\n\\nRotate again: 1 4 3 2 → valid.\\n\\nRotate again: 4 3 2 1 → original. So for n=4, each rotation gives a unique permutation. But in this case, how many unique permutations can we get? For n=4, the number is 4, which is exactly what's needed. So this could be a way to generate n permutations for each test case. \\n\\nSimilarly, for n=3:\\n\\nReverse sorted is 3 2 1 → valid.\\n\\nRotate once: 2 1 3 → check: 2+1=3 → third element is 3. Oh no! That's invalid. Because 2+1=3, which equals the third element. So this permutation would not be valid. So rotating the reverse sorted array may not always work.\\n\\nAh, right. So this approach may not work for all n. For example, when n=3, the rotated array would have 2 1 3, which has 2+1=3. So that permutation is invalid. So the rotation approach works for n=4 but not for n=3.\\n\\nSo the rotation idea is not sufficient. Need another approach.\\n\\nHmm. So perhaps the key is to find a way to generate n permutations for each n. Let's think of a way to generate permutations that start with the same first two elements. For example, if the first two elements are fixed, and the remaining elements are arranged in a way that doesn't create any sum triplet.\\n\\nAlternatively, for the first permutation, use the reverse sorted list. For the next permutations, swap the first element with another element, then arrange the rest in reverse order. But need to ensure that the sum condition holds.\\n\\nWait, let's try to generate permutations where the first two elements are in non-decreasing order. Wait, no, that might not help. Let's think of the problem again. The sum of the first two elements can't be the third element. So for the third element, we need to choose any number except the sum of the first two. Then for the fourth element, it can't be the sum of the second and third, and so on.\\n\\nBut constructing such permutations step by step is possible but computationally intensive. However, given that n is up to 50 and t is 48, and for each test case we need to generate n permutations, perhaps we can precompute all possible permutations for n up to 50. But that's impossible. So a smarter way is needed.\\n\\nLet's think about the case where n is even. Maybe arrange the elements in a way that alternates between high and low numbers. For example, 4,1,3,2. Then 1,4,2,3. But how to ensure that the sum conditions are met.\\n\\nAnother approach: for each permutation, arrange the elements such that all consecutive triplets are either in strictly decreasing order or have the third element not equal to the sum. For example, in a permutation where every third element is placed such that it's less than the sum of the previous two. Since in a permutation, the sum of two elements can be as high as (n + (n-1)), and the next elements are smaller than or equal to n. Wait, but for the reverse sorted list, the sum of any two previous elements is larger than the next element, so the third element can't be the sum. So this is safe.\\n\\nSo the reverse sorted list is a valid permutation. Then, perhaps any permutation that starts with a large number followed by another large number, then the rest in reverse order. Wait, maybe a way to generate multiple permutations is to take the reverse sorted array and then generate permutations by shifting the first element to the end, but that's what the rotation approach does. But as we saw, that can lead to invalid permutations in some cases.\\n\\nSo perhaps the way to generate n different permutations is to generate the reverse sorted array and then create permutations by rotating the array in a way that avoids any triplet sum condition.\\n\\nAlternatively, for each test case, we can generate the reverse sorted permutation and then for the next permutations, shift the elements in some way. Let's think for n=3. Reverse sorted is 3,2,1. Then next permutation could be 3,1,2. Then another permutation could be 2,3,1. Let's check:\\n\\n3,1,2: 3+1=4 !=2. Then 1+2=3, which is the third element in the triplet (positions 2,3, but wait, n=3, so i=3 is the only triplet. So the triplet is positions 1,2,3. So 3+1=4 !=2. So valid. 3,1,2 is valid.\\n\\n2,3,1: 2+3=5 !=1. Then 3+1=4, but there's no fourth element, so valid. So this permutation is valid. Then the third permutation could be 1,3,2. Which is 1+3=4 !=2. So valid. So these three permutations are valid.\\n\\nSo perhaps the approach is to generate permutations by swapping certain elements in the reverse sorted array. For example, in the first permutation, reverse sorted. Then, swap the last two elements. Then swap some other elements. But how to do this systematically.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps for each permutation, the first two elements can be in some order, and the rest are arranged in reverse order. For example:\\n\\nFor n=4:\\n\\nPermutation 1:4,3,2,1 → valid.\\n\\nPermutation 2:3,4,2,1 → check the first triplet:3+4=7 !=2. Then 4+2=6 !=1. So valid.\\n\\nPermutation 3:4,2,3,1 → check 4+2=6 !=3. Then 2+3=5 !=1. Valid.\\n\\nPermutation 4:2,4,3,1 → 2+4=6 !=3. 4+3=7 !=1. Valid.\\n\\nBut how to generate these permutations for all n.\\n\\nAlternatively, for each permutation, take the reverse sorted array and swap elements i and i+1 starting from the end. For example:\\n\\nReverse sorted for n=4 is [4,3,2,1]. Then:\\n\\nPermutation 1: 4,3,2,1 → valid.\\n\\nPermutation 2: 4,3,1,2 → swap 2 and 1. Check: 4+3=7 !=1, 3+1=4 !=2. Valid.\\n\\nPermutation 3: 4,2,3,1 → swap 3 and 2. Check: 4+2=6 !=3, 2+3=5 !=1. Valid.\\n\\nPermutation 4:3,4,2,1 → swap 4 and 3. Check: 3+4=7 !=2, 4+2=6 !=1. Valid.\\n\\nBut this approach for generating permutations may not work for all n. For example, n=3:\\n\\nReverse sorted is [3,2,1].\\n\\nPermutation 1:3,2,1 → valid.\\n\\nPermutation 2:3,1,2 → swap last two elements. Check:3+1=4 !=2. Valid.\\n\\nPermutation3:2,3,1 → swap first two elements. Check:2+3=5 !=1. Valid.\\n\\nSo for n=3, this approach would generate the required 3 permutations.\\n\\nSo the strategy could be:\\n\\nFor each test case with n, generate n permutations by taking the reverse sorted array and then swapping adjacent elements in various positions. But how to systematically generate n distinct permutations.\\n\\nAlternatively, generate the first permutation as the reverse sorted array. Then for each subsequent permutation, swap the first element with the next, then the next, etc. But need to ensure that each permutation is unique and satisfies the condition.\\n\\nWait, but for n=3, the first permutation is 3,2,1. The second could be 2,3,1. Then the third could be 1,3,2. But each of these permutations is valid. Let's check:\\n\\nSecond permutation (2,3,1): 2+3=5 !=1. Valid.\\n\\nThird permutation (1,3,2): 1+3=4 !=2. Valid.\\n\\nSo yes, these are valid.\\n\\nSimilarly, for n=4, permutations can be generated by swapping the first element with the next one each time, then permuting the rest.\\n\\nBut for n=50, doing this would require generating 50 different permutations. For example, the first is reverse sorted. Then, each subsequent permutation is generated by shifting the first element to the right, creating a new permutation each time, and ensuring the sum condition.\\n\\nWait, but when shifting elements, the first two elements may have a sum equal to the third. For example, if the first permutation is 4,3,2,1. Then, swapping the first two elements gives 3,4,2,1. Check sum for the third element:3+4=7 !=2. Sum for the fourth element:4+2=6 !=1. So this permutation is valid. \\n\\nAnother permutation could be 4,2,3,1 (swap 3 and 2). Then sum for third element:4+2=6 !=3. Sum for fourth:2+3=5 !=1. Valid.\\n\\nAnother permutation could be 4,3,1,2 (swap 2 and 1). Sum for third:4+3=7 !=1. Sum for fourth:3+1=4 !=2. Valid.\\n\\nSo generating permutations by swapping adjacent elements in the reverse sorted list seems to generate valid permutations.\\n\\nBut for generating n permutations, perhaps we can generate permutations by rotating the reverse sorted list, but ensuring that the first two elements are not such that their sum is the third element. Wait, but in the case of n=3, rotating once gives 2,1,3. Sum 2+1=3, which is the third element. So this permutation is invalid. So rotating the entire array may not work.\\n\\nHmm. So perhaps the key is to generate permutations where the first two elements are fixed as the largest possible, and the rest are in reverse order, and then vary the first two elements.\\n\\nAlternatively, here's an idea: for the first permutation, reverse sorted. Then, for the next permutations, keep the first element fixed, and permute the rest in a way that the sum condition holds.\\n\\nBut this is vague.\\n\\nAnother approach: For each permutation, arrange the elements in such a way that every even-indexed element is larger than the previous ones. For example, arrange elements in a pattern where high and low elements alternate.\\n\\nBut how to ensure that.\\n\\nWait, let's think of a permutation where elements are arranged in a way that each element is not the sum of the two before. For example, arrange the permutation in such a way that each element is less than the sum of the previous two. Since in the permutation, all elements are unique and up to n, and the sum of any two elements is at least 3 (1+2=3). So for n ≥3, arranging elements in a way that each next element is smaller than the sum of the previous two would work.\\n\\nBut how to construct such a permutation. Well, the reverse sorted list is such a permutation. Because in reverse order, each next element is smaller than the previous ones. So the sum of any two previous elements is larger than the next element.\\n\\nWait, for example, 4,3,2,1. The sum of 4+3=7>2. Then 3+2=5>1. So in this case, the third element is always smaller than the sum of the previous two, so it can't be equal. So all such permutations are valid.\\n\\nSo any permutation that is strictly decreasing satisfies the condition. Because the sum of the previous two elements is larger than the next element, which is smaller than both. So the sum is larger than the next element.\\n\\nSo any permutation that is a strictly decreasing sequence is valid.\\n\\nBut how many such permutations are there? For n elements, the number of strictly decreasing permutations is 1. But the problem requires generating n different permutations for each n.\\n\\nSo this approach gives only one valid permutation. So we need to find other permutations.\\n\\nBut perhaps permutations that are almost strictly decreasing, with some swaps that don't affect the sum condition.\\n\\nFor example, take the reverse sorted array and swap two elements that are not in the first two positions. Let's see. For example, for n=4: [4,3,2,1]. Swap 3 and 2 → [4,2,3,1]. Check:\\n\\n4+2=6 !=3. 2+3=5 !=1. So valid.\\n\\nAnother swap: [4,3,1,2]. Check sums: 4+3=7 !=1. 3+1=4 !=2. Valid.\\n\\nSo these permutations are valid. So perhaps generating permutations by swapping elements in the reverse sorted array (but not the first two) could generate valid permutations. But how to generate n distinct permutations.\\n\\nAlternatively, generate permutations by taking the reverse sorted array and then permuting the elements starting from the third position. For example, for the first permutation, the entire array is reverse sorted. Then, for the second permutation, reverse sorted except the last two elements are swapped. For third permutation, swap the third and fourth elements. Etc. But this would generate permutations where the first two elements are the same as the first permutation. For n permutations, perhaps this approach can generate enough permutations.\\n\\nBut for n=4, that's possible. Let's see:\\n\\nPermutation 1:4,3,2,1.\\n\\nPermutation 2:4,3,1,2.\\n\\nPermutation3:4,3,2,1 → no, that's the same. So perhaps this approach would not generate enough permutations.\\n\\nHmm. So perhaps the solution is to generate the reverse sorted array as the first permutation, then generate permutations by moving the first element to the end, then shifting others. But as we saw earlier, this can lead to invalid permutations.\\n\\nAlternatively, here's another approach inspired by the sample input. For the first permutation, arrange the elements in reverse order. For the next permutations, take the previous permutation and swap the first element with the second, then the third with the fourth, and so on. But this may not always work.\\n\\nAlternatively, consider that any permutation where the first two elements are in a certain order, and the rest are arranged in reverse order. For example, for each permutation, the first two elements are arranged in a certain way, and the rest are in reverse order. Then, the sum of the first two elements is greater than the third (which is the next largest element not in the first two). Let's see.\\n\\nFor example, take n=4. Let the first two elements be 4 and 3. The rest are 2,1 → reverse order. So permutation is 4,3,2,1 → valid.\\n\\nAnother permutation: first two elements are 3 and4, rest are 2,1 → permutation 3,4,2,1. Check sum 3+4=7 !=2. Then 4+2=6 !=1. So valid.\\n\\nAnother permutation: first two elements 4 and 2, rest are 3,1. Sum 4+2=6 !=3. Then 2+3=5 !=1. Valid.\\n\\nSo for each permutation, select a different pair of first two elements (from the highest elements), then arrange the remaining elements in reverse order. But how to select n distinct pairs for n up to 50.\\n\\nWait, but the number of possible pairs is (n choose 2), which for n=50 is 1225, which is way more than needed. So for each permutation, we can choose a different pair of first two elements, arrange the rest in reverse order, and ensure that the sum of the first two elements is not equal to the third.\\n\\nBut the third element is the next largest after the first two. For example, if the first two are 4 and3, the third is 2. Then sum is 7, which is not equal to 2. So it's okay. Similarly, if first two are 4 and2, third element is 3. Sum 6, which is not equal to 3. So okay.\\n\\nBut what if the first two elements sum to the third. For example, n=5. First two elements are 1 and 2. Then third element is 3. Sum is 3, which equals the third element. So this permutation would be invalid.\\n\\nBut in our strategy, the first two elements are chosen as the highest possible, which sum to a larger value than the third element. So for example, if the first two elements are 5 and4, sum is9. Third element is 3. So no problem.\\n\\nSo, to avoid the sum being equal to the third element, the third element must be less than the sum of the first two. Which it will be if the first two elements are large enough.\\n\\nSo the approach is: generate permutations where the first two elements are two distinct elements, and the rest are arranged in reverse order. To ensure that the sum of the first two is not equal to the third element. Since the third element is the largest remaining element (as the rest are in reverse order), which is less than the first two elements. Thus, the sum of the first two will be larger than the third element, so the sum cannot equal the third. So this approach would generate valid permutations.\\n\\nThus, for each permutation, select a pair of first two elements (any two distinct elements), then arrange the remaining elements in reverse order (descending). As long as the sum of the first two is not equal to the third, which in this case is the maximum of the remaining elements. But since the first two elements are larger than the third, their sum is larger than the third, so the third element can't be equal to the sum.\\n\\nWait, for example, first two elements are 3 and 2. The third element is 4. Wait, no. If the first two elements are 3 and2, the remaining elements are 1,4. Wait, no. The remaining elements after selecting the first two are all the other numbers. Then arranged in reverse order (descending), so the third element is the maximum of the remaining elements.\\n\\nWait, for example, first two elements are 3 and 2. The remaining elements are 1,4,5 (if n=5). Wait, no. For n=5, the remaining elements after 3 and2 are 1,4,5? No, wait, original elements are 1,2,3,4,5. If first two elements are 3 and2, then the remaining elements are 1,4,5. Arranged in reverse order (5,4,1). So third element is5. Then the sum of first two is3+2=5, which equals the third element. So this permutation would be invalid.\\n\\nOh right. So in this case, the third element is 5, which is the sum of the first two (3+2=5). So this permutation would be invalid.\\n\\nSo this approach may not work. So the problem is that the third element can be the sum of the first two. So even though the first two elements are larger than the third element (if the third is part of the remaining elements arranged in reverse order), this may not hold.\\n\\nWait, in the previous example, the first two elements are 3 and2, and the third is5. But5 is larger than both 3 and2. So in that case, the sum of the first two is5, which is equal to the third element. So the permutation is invalid.\\n\\nSo this approach isn't safe. So how to avoid this.\\n\\nThe key is to select the first two elements such that their sum is not equal to the maximum of the remaining elements. But how to ensure that.\\n\\nAlternatively, after selecting the first two elements, arrange the remaining elements in a way that the third element is not the sum of the first two. But this complicates the approach.\\n\\nHmm. So perhaps the solution is to generate permutations where the first two elements are two large numbers, followed by the rest in reverse order. For example, for n=5:\\n\\nPermutation 1:5,4,3,2,1 → valid.\\n\\nPermutation 2:5,3,4,2,1 → check first two elements sum 8, third element4. 8 !=4. Then 3+4=7 !=2. Etc. So valid.\\n\\nPermutation3:4,5,3,2,1 → sum 9 !=3. Valid.\\n\\nPermutation4:5,2,4,3,1 → sum 5+2=7 !=4. Valid.\\n\\nPermutation5:2,5,4,3,1 → sum 7 !=4. Valid.\\n\\nBut how to generate these permutations systematically.\\n\\nAlternatively, the first permutation is the reverse sorted list. Then, for the next permutations, swap the second element with each possible other element, then arrange the remaining elements in reverse order.\\n\\nWait, but for n=5, the first permutation is [5,4,3,2,1]. The second permutation could be [5,3,4,2,1]. The third [5,2,4,3,1]. Fourth [5,1,4,3,2]. Fifth [4,5,3,2,1], etc. But how to generate n permutations this way.\\n\\nBut this approach requires generating permutations with varying second elements. Let's see:\\n\\nFor each permutation, the first element is 5, and the second element is each of the other elements (4,3,2,1). Then, the remaining elements are arranged in reverse order of the remaining numbers. So for each permutation, the first two are (5, x), where x is in 4,3,2,1. Then, the remaining elements are sorted in reverse order. For example:\\n\\nIf x=3, remaining elements are 4,2,1. Reverse sorted is 4,2,1. So permutation is [5,3,4,2,1].\\n\\nCheck sum for the third element:5+3=8 !=4. Then 3+4=7 !=2. 4+2=6 !=1. So valid.\\n\\nBut for the permutation where first two elements are5 and2, remaining elements are4,3,1. Reverse sorted as4,3,1. So permutation is [5,2,4,3,1]. Check sum:5+2=7 !=4. Valid.\\n\\nFor first two elements 5 and1: remaining elements are4,3,2. Reverse sorted 4,3,2. Permutation [5,1,4,3,2]. Check sum 5+1=6 !=4. Valid.\\n\\nSo these permutations are valid. For n=5, this approach could generate 4 permutations (since the first element is fixed as5, and the second can be 4,3,2,1 → four permutations). But we need to generate 5 permutations. So this approach alone is not sufficient.\\n\\nThus, another idea: vary the first element as well. For example, the first permutation is [5,4,3,2,1]. Second permutation is [4,5,3,2,1]. Third [5,3,4,2,1]. Fourth [3,5,4,2,1]. Fifth [5,2,4,3,1]. Etc. But this requires generating permutations with different first elements.\\n\\nBut how to ensure that for each permutation, the first two elements sum to something that's not equal to the third element.\\n\\nAlternatively, arrange the first two elements in a way that their sum is not present in the remaining elements.\\n\\nBut how to do that. For example, for each permutation, the first two elements are selected such that their sum is greater than the maximum possible element in the permutation. But since the maximum possible element is n, and the sum of the first two elements (if they are the two largest elements) is (n-1) +n = 2n-1, which is larger than n. So their sum is larger than any element in the permutation, including the third. So the third element cannot be equal to the sum.\\n\\nSo if the first two elements are the two largest elements, their sum is larger than any other element. So the third element (which is the next largest) will be less than the sum. So this is safe.\\n\\nSo, permutations where the first two elements are the two largest elements (in any order) and the rest are in reverse order. For example:\\n\\nn=5:\\n\\n[5,4,3,2,1] → sum 9. Third element 3 <9. Valid.\\n\\n[4,5,3,2,1] → sum 9. Third element 3 <9. Valid.\\n\\nThese are two valid permutations.\\n\\nBut for n=5, we need five permutations. So the next permutations can have first two elements as the next possible pairs.\\n\\nWait, but the two largest elements can be arranged in any order, but how many permutations can that generate? For example, the two largest can be arranged as (5,4) or (4,5), generating two permutations. Then, for the other permutations, perhaps use pairs of next largest elements.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nThird permutation:5,3,4,2,1 → sum 8. Third element4 <8. Valid.\\n\\nFourth permutation:3,5,4,2,1 → sum8. Third element4 <8. Valid.\\n\\nFifth permutation:5,2,4,3,1 → sum7. Third element4 <7. Valid.\\n\\nSo these permutations are valid. But how to generate them in a systematic way.\\n\\nAlternatively, for each permutation, the first two elements can be any pair (a, b) such that a and b are distinct and a + b > next element. Since the next element is the maximum of the remaining elements, which is the next largest after the two selected.\\n\\nBut the next largest after selecting two elements (say, x and y) would be the third largest in the original list. So if x and y are the two largest elements, their sum is (n-1) +n= 2n-1, which is larger than the next element (n-2). So the third element is n-2, which is less than the sum. So the sum can't be equal.\\n\\nThus, for any permutation where the first two elements are any two elements (not necessarily the two largest), but their sum is larger than the next element, the permutation is valid. But how to ensure that.\\n\\nAlternatively, for each permutation, the first two elements are any two elements, and the remaining elements are arranged in reverse order. Then, check if the sum of the first two is not equal to the third element. If not, the permutation is valid. \\n\\nBut how to generate n such permutations for each n. \\n\\nAlternatively, the following strategy:\\n\\nFor each permutation, generate a permutation where the first element is the maximum possible, and the second element is chosen such that the sum of first two is not equal to the third. Then the rest are arranged in reverse order.\\n\\nBut again, this is vague.\\n\\nAlternatively, for the first permutation, use reverse sorted order. For the second permutation, swap the first and second elements. For the third permutation, swap the second and third elements. And so on. But need to ensure that each swap doesn't create a triplet that violates the condition.\\n\\nBut for large n, this would be time-consuming.\\n\\nWait, perhaps a pattern can be found by examining the sample inputs.\\n\\nFor n=3, the sample output includes:\\n\\n3 2 1 → valid.\\n\\n1 3 2 → valid.\\n\\n3 1 2 → valid.\\n\\nThese permutations have different first elements. So for n=3, the approach is to generate permutations with varying first elements. For example, the first permutation starts with3, the second with1, and the third with3 again.\\n\\nBut how to generate these in a general way.\\n\\nAnother idea: generate a set of permutations where each permutation starts with a different element and is followed by a permutation of the remaining elements that satisfies the condition. For example, for n=4, the first permutation starts with4, the next with3, then2, then1. But how to ensure that each permutation is valid.\\n\\nAlternatively, for each permutation in the output, the first element is i, where i ranges from n down to 1, and the remaining elements are arranged in a certain way. For example:\\n\\nPermutation 1: n, n-1, n-2, ..., 1 → valid.\\n\\nPermutation2: n-1, n, n-2, ..., 1 → sum of first two is (n-1 +n) = 2n-1 >n-2 → valid.\\n\\nPermutation3: n-2, ... → etc.\\n\\nBut generating permutations where the first element cycles through each possible value, and the remaining elements are arranged in reverse order. For example, for each permutation, the first element is different, and the rest are arranged in reverse order of the remaining elements.\\n\\nThis way, the first element varies, and the rest are in reverse order. This could generate n distinct permutations. Let's check for n=4:\\n\\nPermutation1:4,3,2,1 → valid.\\n\\nPermutation2:3,4,2,1 → sum 3+4=7 !=2 → valid.\\n\\nPermutation3:2,4,3,1 → sum 6 !=3 → valid.\\n\\nPermutation4:1,4,3,2 → sum5 !=3 → valid.\\n\\nSo all four permutations are valid.\\n\\nFor n=3:\\n\\nPermutation1:3,2,1 → valid.\\n\\nPermutation2:2,3,1 → sum5 !=1 → valid.\\n\\nPermutation3:1,3,2 → sum4 !=2 → valid.\\n\\nSo this approach works for the sample input and for n=4.\\n\\nSo the strategy is:\\n\\nFor each test case, generate n permutations where the i-th permutation starts with the element (n - (i-1)) (so for the first permutation it's n, second n-1, etc.), and the remaining elements are arranged in reverse order of the remaining elements. \\n\\nBut wait, for the second permutation, the first element is n-1. Then the remaining elements are n, n-2, n-3, ..., 1. So the permutation would be n-1, n, n-2, n-3,...1. Let's check for n=4:\\n\\nSecond permutation is3,4,2,1. The first two elements are3 and4. Sum is7. The third element is2. 7 !=2. Then 4+2=6 !=1. So valid.\\n\\nThird permutation for n=4 would be2,4,3,1. Sum 2+4=6 !=3. Then4+3=7 !=1. Valid.\\n\\nFourth permutation is1,4,3,2. Sum1+4=5 !=3. Then4+3=7 !=2. Valid.\\n\\nYes. So this approach generates n distinct permutations, each starting with a different first element, and the remaining elements arranged in reverse order of the remaining elements (excluding the first).\\n\\nBut how to generate the remaining elements for each permutation.\\n\\nFor example, for permutation i, the first element is (n - i + 1). The remaining elements are all elements except the first, sorted in reverse order.\\n\\nWait, for permutation 1: first element is n. The remaining elements are n-1, n-2, ...,1 → reverse sorted.\\n\\nPermutation2: first element is n-1. The remaining elements are n, n-2, n-3, ...,1 → sorted in reverse order. So arrange them in reverse order (n, n-2, n-3,...1). So the permutation would be n-1, n, n-2, n-3, ...,1.\\n\\nYes. So the remaining elements are all elements except the first, sorted in reverse order.\\n\\nSo for permutation i:\\n\\nfirst element = (n - (i-1)) → for i from 1 to n.\\n\\nThe remaining elements are sorted in reverse order.\\n\\nBut how to generate the remaining elements. Let's think.\\n\\nFor permutation i, the first element is k = n - (i-1). Then the remaining elements are [1, 2, ..., n] without k. Then sorted in reverse order.\\n\\nFor example, n=4, permutation2 (i=2) has first element4-1=3. The remaining elements are [1,2,4]. sorted in reverse order:4,2,1. So permutation is3,4,2,1.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nSo for each permutation i:\\n\\nThe first element is (n - i + 1).\\n\\nThe remaining elements are the list of numbers from 1 to n excluding (n-i+1), sorted in reverse order.\\n\\nThis approach will generate n distinct permutations, each starting with a different element. Let's verify for n=3:\\n\\npermutation1:3,2,1 → valid.\\n\\npermutation2:2,3,1 → sum5 !=1 → valid.\\n\\npermutation3:1,3,2 → sum4 !=2 → valid.\\n\\nYes, all valid.\\n\\nNow, for each permutation, the sum of the first two elements is (k + m), where k is the first element, and m is the next element. For the permutation generated by this approach, the next element is the largest remaining element after k. So for example, in permutation i, the first element is k. The next element is the largest remaining element, which is (the maximum of the remaining elements). So when k is the largest element (permutation1), the next element is k-1. But for other permutations, the next element can be the actual maximum of the remaining elements.\\n\\nWait, for permutation i=2 in n=4: first element is3. Remaining elements are [1,2,4]. sorted reverse is4,2,1. So the next element is4. So first two elements are3 and4. sum7.\\n\\nThird element is2. sum7 !=2. Valid.\\n\\nFor permutation i=3 in n=4: first element is2. Remaining elements are [1,3,4]. sorted reverse is4,3,1. So the next element is4. Sum2+4=6. Third element is3. 6 !=3. Valid.\\n\\nSo in this approach, the sum of the first two elements is (k + m), where m is the maximum of the remaining elements. So sum is (k + (the next largest element after k)). But in this case, for permutations where k is not the maximum, the sum k + m could be larger than any possible third element. For example, if k is 3 and m is4 (n=4), sum is7. third element is2. 7 !=2. So valid.\\n\\nBut what if k is 1 and m is4 (n=4)? sum is5. third element is3. 5 !=3. So valid.\\n\\nThus, this approach will generate permutations where the sum of the first two elements is larger than the third element. Hence, the third element cannot be equal to the sum. The remaining elements are arranged in reverse order. So each triplet after that will have elements in reverse order, ensuring that the sum of the previous two is larger than the next element.\\n\\nThus, all permutations generated by this approach will be valid.\\n\\nSo this approach solves the problem. For each permutation, the first element is different, and the remaining elements are arranged in reverse order. This generates n distinct permutations, each of which is valid.\\n\\nThus, the code can be written as follows:\\n\\nFor each test case n:\\n\\n- For i in 0 to n-1:\\n\\n   - The first element is n - i.\\n\\n   - The remaining elements are all elements except (n-i), sorted in descending order.\\n\\n   - Combine the first element with the remaining elements to form the permutation.\\n\\nFor example, n=3:\\n\\ni=0: first element is3. remaining elements [2,1]. permutation [3,2,1].\\n\\ni=1: first element is2. remaining elements [3,1]. sorted reverse → [3,1]. permutation [2,3,1].\\n\\ni=2: first element is1. remaining elements [3,2]. sorted reverse → [3,2]. permutation [1,3,2].\\n\\nThese are three distinct permutations, all valid.\\n\\nFor n=4:\\n\\ni=0:4 → remaining [3,2,1] → [4,3,2,1]\\n\\ni=1:3 → remaining [4,2,1] → [3,4,2,1]\\n\\ni=2:2 → remaining [4,3,1] → [2,4,3,1]\\n\\ni=3:1 → remaining [4,3,2] → [1,4,3,2]\\n\\nEach of these permutations is valid.\\n\\nThus, this approach is correct.\\n\\nNow, the code can be written to generate these permutations.\\n\\nSo the code will:\\n\\nRead t test cases.\\n\\nFor each test case, read n.\\n\\nGenerate n permutations, each with first element n - i (for i from 0 to n-1), and the remaining elements are sorted in reverse order.\\n\\nThus, the code is straightforward.\\n\\nNow, implement this in Python.\\n\\nFor each permutation:\\n\\nThe first element is k = n - i.\\n\\nThe rest of the elements are sorted in reverse order, excluding k.\\n\\nFor example, for k=3 in n=4:\\n\\nremaining = [1,2,4] → sorted reverse is [4,2,1].\\n\\nThus, the permutation is [3,4,2,1].\\n\\nThe code can generate this as follows:\\n\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\n    k = n - i\\n\\n    rest = sorted([x for x in range(1, n+1) if x != k], reverse=True)\\n\\n    permutation = [k] + rest\\n\\n    print(' '.join(map(str, permutation)))\\n\\nBut wait, for n=3, when i=2:\\n\\nk=1.\\n\\nrest is [3,2].\\n\\nsorted in reverse → [3,2].\\n\\npermutation is [1,3,2]. Which is valid.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nSo this code generates the required permutations.\\n\\nThus, the code is correct.\\n</think>\\n\\n```python\\nt = int(input())\\nfor _ in range(t):\\n    n = int(input())\\n    for i in range(n):\\n        k = n - i\\n        rest = sorted((x for x in range(1, n+1) if x != k), reverse=True)\\n        print(' '.join(map(str, [k] + rest)))\\n```\", 'role': 'assistant'}]\n"

       "Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully and understand what's required.</p>\n",
       "<p>The problem is about maintaining a set of points and answering queries about symmetry. The three query types are adding a point, removing a point, and calculating the minimum number of points needed to make the set symmetric with respect to a given line. The line is determined by two points: the origin (0,0) and the given (xi, yi). So the line for each type 3 query is the line passing through (0,0) and (xi, yi).</p>\n",
       "<p>The key here is, for each type 3 query, determine how many points need to be added so that the set A is symmetric with respect to that line. The answer is the minimum number of points required.</p>\n",
       "<p>Hmm. So for each point in A, its reflection across the line should also be present. If a point is already on the line, then it's its own reflection, so it only needs to be present once. Otherwise, for a pair (p, reflection of p), if both are present, no additions needed. If only one is present, then we need to add the other.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but the question is asking for the minimal number of points to add to make the entire set symmetric. So for each type 3 query, we have to consider the current set A and compute the required additions.</p>\n",
       "<p>But since each type 3 query is independent (the additions are not actually made), the solution must efficiently compute for each query the required number.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the approach for each type 3 query is:</p>\n",
       "<ol>\n",
       "<li>For the given line L (through origin and (xi, yi)), compute the reflection of every point in A across L. Then, for each point, check if its reflection is present. The minimal additions needed would be the number of points in A whose reflections are not present, but considering that pairs are handled once (since if p is present but reflection not, then adding the reflection would cover both).</li>\n",
       "</ol>\n",
       "<p>Wait, no. Let's think:</p>\n",
       "<p>Suppose the set A has some points. For symmetry, every point must have its reflection in the set. So for each point p in A, if the reflection q of p across L is not in A, then to make the set symmetric, we need to add q. But if p is already on L, then q is p, so no need to add anything. So the total required is the number of points in A that are not on the line L and whose reflection is not present in A. However, this needs to be calculated in a way that avoids double counting. For example, if p is in A, and q (reflection) is not, then this contributes 1 to the count. But when we process q (if it's in A), then perhaps it would contribute again. So to avoid double counting, we need to process each pair once.</p>\n",
       "<p>So perhaps, for each type 3 query, we can:</p>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>For each point p in A, compute its reflection q across L. Then, if p is not on L, check if q is in A. If q is not in A, then that's a required addition. However, since p and q are reflections of each other, this check might be done for both, leading to double-counting. So to avoid that, we need to process each pair once.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<p>But how to do this efficiently? Because for each query, iterating through all points in A (which could be up to 1e5) would be O(q) per query, which would be 1e5 * 1e5 = 1e10 operations. That's way too slow.</p>\n",
       "<p>So we need a smarter way. The challenge is to compute the answer for each type 3 query quickly, given that there can be up to 1e5 such queries.</p>\n",
       "<p>Hmm. So, for each type 3 query, the line is given by (xi, yi) and (0,0). Let's find the equation of the line. But perhaps more importantly, we can represent the reflection of a point (x, y) across this line.</p>\n",
       "<p>The reflection of a point (a, b) across a line defined by ax + by + c =0 can be computed using a formula. But in this case, the line passes through the origin. So the line can be represented as (y_i)x - (x_i)y = 0. Wait, the line passes through (0,0) and (xi, yi). So the direction vector is (xi, yi). The line's equation is y = (yi/xi)x if xi is not zero. But perhaps a better approach is to find the reflection formula.</p>\n",
       "<p>The reflection of a point (x, y) across the line through the origin and (a, b) can be calculated using the formula derived from linear algebra. Let me recall the formula for reflection over a line.</p>\n",
       "<p>The general formula for reflecting a point (x, y) over the line defined by ax + by = 0 is:</p>\n",
       "<p>The formula can be derived using projection. Let's denote the line as vector (a, b). Wait, the line is given by two points (0,0) and (xi, yi). So the line is in the direction of (xi, yi). Let's call the direction vector (xi, yi). So the reflection formula for a point (x, y) over this line can be computed as follows.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, since the line is given by two points, the reflection can be computed by a rotation. For a line through the origin, the reflection matrix can be used. Let me think: the reflection of a point (x, y) over a line through the origin making an angle θ with the x-axis can be found by:</p>\n",
       "<ol>\n",
       "<li>Rotating the coordinate system by -θ, so the line becomes the x-axis.</li>\n",
       "<li>Reflect over the x-axis (which changes (x, y) to (x, -y)).</li>\n",
       "<li>Rotate back by θ.</li>\n",
       "</ol>\n",
       "<p>But perhaps there's a more direct formula. Let's find it.</p>\n",
       "<p>Suppose the line is defined by a vector (a, b) (from the origin to (a, b)). Then, the reflection of a point (x, y) across this line can be computed using the formula:</p>\n",
       "<p>The formula is:</p>\n",
       "<p>Let me check. For a line through the origin with direction (a, b), the reflection of a point (x, y) can be found as follows.</p>\n",
       "<p>The formula is given here (after some research):</p>\n",
       "<p>If the line is given by ax + by = 0 (but since it's through the origin, any line through (0,0) can be written as y = m x, but in vector terms).</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, the formula for reflection over a line in vector form is:</p>\n",
       "<p>If the line is parametrized as t(v), where v is a direction vector, then the reflection can be expressed using the projection of the point onto the line.</p>\n",
       "<p>Let me denote the line as the set of points t*(xi, yi), where t is a scalar. Then, the reflection of a point (x, y) over this line is:</p>\n",
       "<p>The projection of (x, y) onto the line is given by ( (x<em>xi + y</em>yi)/(xi² + yi²) ) * (xi, yi). Then, the reflection point is 2*projection - (x, y).</p>\n",
       "<p>Ah, right! That's the formula. So the reflection of a point (x, y) over the line through the origin and (xi, yi) is:</p>\n",
       "<p>Let denominator = xi² + yi².</p>\n",
       "<p>Then, the projection scalar t is (x * xi + y * yi) / denominator.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the projection vector is t<em>(xi, yi) = ( (x</em>xi + y<em>yi)</em>xi / denominator , (x<em>xi + y</em>yi)*yi / denominator )</p>\n",
       "<p>Then, the reflection is 2*projection minus the original point.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the reflection (x', y') is:</p>\n",
       "<p>x' = 2 * t * xi - x</p>\n",
       "<p>y' = 2 * t * yi - y</p>\n",
       "<p>Substituting t:</p>\n",
       "<p>x' = 2<em>(x</em>xi + y<em>yi)</em>xi / (xi² + yi²) - x</p>\n",
       "<p>y' = 2<em>(x</em>xi + y<em>yi)</em>yi / (xi² + yi²) - y</p>\n",
       "<p>But since (xi, yi) is given for the query, for each point (x, y) in A, we can compute its reflection (x', y') across the line defined by (xi, yi) and the origin.</p>\n",
       "<p>But this calculation needs to be done for each point in A for a type 3 query, which could be up to 1e5 points. If we have 1e5 type 3 queries, each taking O(n) time, this is O(1e10) operations, which is way too slow.</p>\n",
       "<p>So this approach is not feasible. We need a smarter way.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, the problem is that for each type 3 query, the line can be different, so precomputing something for all possible lines isn't feasible. However, perhaps we can find a way to represent points and their reflections in a way that allows us to quickly count the required number of points for a given query.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternative approach: For each type 3 query, the answer is the total number of points in A that are not on the line, and for which their reflection across the line is not present in A. But this needs to be divided by two, since each pair (p, q) would be counted twice if both are present. Wait, no.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, for a point p not on the line, if its reflection q is not in A, then we need to add q to make the set symmetric. However, if both p and q are in A, then no addition is needed.</p>\n",
       "<p>So for each point in A, if it's not on the line and its reflection is not present, then we have to add the reflection. But how do we count this without double-counting?</p>\n",
       "<p>For example, suppose A contains p but not q. Then the reflection of p is q, which is not present. So p contributes +1 to the answer. Similarly, if we then consider q (which is not in A), its reflection is p, which is present. So q would contribute 0 (since q is not in A). Wait, but q is not in A. So in this case, the answer is 1, because we need to add q. So the total required is the number of points in A where their reflection (for the given line) is not in A, and the point is not on the line. Then, sum all those, and that's the answer.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, perhaps the answer is the number of points in A that are not on the line and whose reflection is not present in A. Because for each such point, we need to add their reflection.</p>\n",
       "<p>But wait, if both p and q are not in A, but p is being considered, but since p is not in A, but q is in A, then that's okay. Wait, no. The set A is the current set. So for the reflection to exist, every point in A must have its reflection in A.</p>\n",
       "<p>So for any point p in A, if p is not on the line, then q (its reflection) must also be in A. If q is not present, then we need to add q. So the number of points to add is the number of points in A not on the line for which their reflection is not in A.</p>\n",
       "<p>But if p is in A and q is not, then adding q would take care of both p and q. However, in the current set A, if after adding q, both are present. But during the calculation, we need to count how many points in A require their reflections to be present.</p>\n",
       "<p>So for each query 3, the answer is the number of points p in A that are not on the line L, and where reflection(p) is not in A. Because for each such p, we need to add reflection(p) once.</p>\n",
       "<p>But what if p and q are both in A? Then they don't contribute to the answer. So the answer is the count of all p in A (not on L) where reflection(p) not in A.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the approach for each type 3 query is:</p>\n",
       "<p>Compute the line L (given by (xi, yi) and (0,0)).</p>\n",
       "<p>For each point p in A:</p>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>Check if p is on L. If yes, then no action needed.</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>If not, compute reflection q of p across L.</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>Check if q is in A. If not, then this p contributes 1 to the answer.</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<p>The sum of all such contributions is the required answer.</p>\n",
       "<p>But with A potentially having up to 1e5 points, and each query processing all points, this is O(q * n) which is 1e5 * 1e5 = 1e10 operations. That's way too slow.</p>\n",
       "<p>So this approach is not feasible. We need a way to compute this count efficiently.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternative idea: For each possible line L, we can precompute the necessary information. But the number of possible lines is infinite (since xi and yi can be up to 1e5), so this is impossible.</p>\n",
       "<p>So we need a way to represent the problem such that for any given line L, we can compute the required count quickly.</p>\n",
       "<p>Hmm. Let's think about the reflection formula. The reflection of a point (x, y) over line L (defined by (xi, yi)) is a function that depends on xi and yi. For a given query's line L, we need to compute for each point in A whether their reflection is present in A.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how can we represent this in a way that allows us to quickly look up the reflection of a point for any given L?</p>\n",
       "<p>The problem is that for each query, the line L can be different, so the reflection of each point depends on L's parameters (xi, yi). So for each query, we have to compute reflections on the fly, but we can't do that for each point in O(1) per point.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, what's the alternative?</p>\n",
       "<p>Let me think: perhaps, for a given line L, the reflection of a point (x, y) is (x', y'), which can be represented as a linear transformation. So for each point, the reflection can be computed using the formula derived earlier. But even then, for a given L, each reflection is unique per point.</p>\n",
       "<p>So how can we compute, for all points in A, how many have their reflection in A, for a given L?</p>\n",
       "<p>The key is to find a way to compute, for each query line L, the number of points p in A such that p is not on L and their reflection q is not in A.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how?</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternative idea: For each query line L, the answer is equal to the number of points in A not on L minus twice the number of pairs (p, q) where q is the reflection of p. Because for each pair (p, q), both p and q are in A and not on L, then they contribute 0 to the answer. If only one is present, it contributes 1. So the total is the number of points not on L minus 2 * (number of pairs where both are present). Because for each such pair, they contribute 0, so they are subtracted twice from the total.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, maybe not. Let's think:</p>\n",
       "<p>Let S be the set of points in A not on L. Let R be the set of reflections of these points. Let C be the number of pairs (p, q) where p is in S, q is in S, and q is the reflection of p. But since p and q are reflections of each other, each pair is counted once here. So the total number of points in S is |S|. The number of points that are in pairs is 2C. Because each pair contributes two points. So the total points in pairs is 2C, and the remaining points (|S| - 2C) are those that are not paired with their reflection. Each such unpaired point contributes 1 to the answer. So the answer is (|S| - 2C) + (|S| - 2C) = |S| - 2C. Wait, no. Wait, for each unpaired point, their reflection is not present, so each such point contributes 1 to the answer. The total number of such points is |S| - 2C. So the answer is |S| - 2C.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to compute this quickly.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the answer for query L is:</p>\n",
       "<p>number of points not on L (let's call this S) → S = |A| - count of points on L.</p>\n",
       "<p>Then, the number of points that form pairs (p and q) is 2C, so the unpaired points are S - 2C. So answer is S - 2C.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to compute C? C is the number of pairs (p, q) where q is the reflection of p and both are in S. So for each such pair, both are present. So C is the number of such pairs, but each pair is counted once.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, C is the number of points p in S such that their reflection q is also in S and p is before q in some ordering (to avoid double counting). But perhaps in practice, the number of such pairs is equal to the number of points p where their reflection q is in S and p is lex order less than q. But this complicates things.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, for each p in S, check if q is in S, and count how many such p where q is in S and p is not equal to q. But this would count each pair twice. So C would be (number of pairs) = (count of such p) / 2.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, let's think: suppose p and q are reflections of each other and both are in S. Then p is in S, and when we process p, we find that q is present. Similarly, when processing q, we find that p is present. So the total count (if we count all p where their reflection is present) would be 2C, where C is the number of such pairs. So C is the number of pairs, and the total count is 2C.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to compute the total count of p in S where their reflection is also in S?</p>\n",
       "<p>Let me call this count D. Then D = 2C.</p>\n",
       "<p>Thus, the answer is S - D.</p>\n",
       "<p>Because:</p>\n",
       "<p>Each pair (p, q) contributes 0 to the answer (since both are present). So they are subtracted from the total S. The total S is the sum of:</p>\n",
       "<ul>\n",

       "<p>points whose reflection is not present (contribute 1 each)</p>\n",

       "<p>So the answer is (S - D) + 0 * C = S - D.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, S is the number of points not on L. D is the number of points p in S where their reflection is present (could be p itself if p is on the line, but p is in S, which is points not on the line. Wait no. S is points not on L. So if p is in S, then p is not on L, so reflection q can't be equal to p (unless the line is such that p is on the line, but since p is in S, it's not). So the reflection q is a different point than p. So if both p and q are in S, then they form a pair.</p>\n",
       "<p>So D is the number of points p in S where q (their reflection) is also in S. So for each pair (p, q), D counts both p and q, so each pair contributes 2 to D. So the number of pairs is D / 2.</p>\n",
       "<p>Thus, the answer is S - D.</p>\n",
       "<p>But S = |A| - (number of points on L).</p>\n",

       "<p>Alternative approach: For each query of type 3, the line L is determined by (xi, yi). Let's note that the line L can be uniquely represented by its direction vector (xi, yi). However, since (xi, yi) can be scaled, lines that are the same (like (2, 4) and (1, 2)) are the same line, but in the problem, (xi, yi) is given as per the input. So for the line L, the direction is (xi, yi), and for reflection purposes, the line is defined by this vector.</p>\n",
       "<p>But the reflection formula is based on the line's direction. So for each query line L, given (xi, yi), we can compute the reflection of each point in A.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to compute this efficiently.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, perhaps the reflection of a point (x, y) across L can be represented as a rational number, but that's not helpful.</p>\n",

       "<p>But when reflecting, the reflection (x', y') may not be an integer point. For example, reflecting (1, 0) across the line (1, 1) would give a point with non-integer coordinates. So the reflection may not be an integer point, which implies that the reflection of a point in A may not be present in A. Thus, in the majority of cases, the reflection of a point will not be in A, leading to a higher count.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to represent this.</p>\n",
       "<p>But even if the reflection is a non-integer point, if the original point is in A, we need to check whether the reflection (which may be a non-integer) is present in A. But since all points in A are integer points, the reflection can only be present if it's also an integer point.</p>\n",
       "<p>So for the reflection (x', y') of (x, y), if x' and y' are integers, then we can check if (x', y') is in A. Otherwise, it's definitely not in A, so the count for that point would be 1.</p>\n",

       "<p>But this doesn't help us compute D.</p>\n",
       "<p>Hmm. Let's think of the problem differently. For each type 3 query, the line L is determined by (xi, yi). Let's compute the number of points in A not on L and whose reflection is in A. Let's call this D.</p>\n",

       "<p>For S: It's the total number of points in A minus the number of points in A that are on line L.</p>\n",
       "<p>The number of points on line L can be computed by checking for each point (x, y) whether (x, y) lies on the line passing through (0, 0) and (xi, yi). The line equation is (yi)x - (xi)y = 0. So for a point (x, y) to be on L, it must satisfy yi * x == xi * y.</p>\n",
       "<p>So for a given query L (xi, yi), the count of points on L is the number of points in A that satisfy yi * x == xi * y.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to compute this count quickly.</p>\n",
       "<p>If we can maintain a hash map (like a dictionary) that maps the line equation (a, b) to the count of points in A that are on the line ax - by = 0, then for each query (xi, yi), we can compute the line equation as (yi, xi) (since yi * x - xi * y =0). Then, look up the count in the hash map. But lines are represented by (a, b) where a = yi, b = xi. However, the line represented by (a, b) is the same as (k<em>a, k</em>b) for any non-zero k.

       "<li>\n",
       "<p>Ensure that the denominator is positive. If (a', b') has a negative denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by -1. Wait, maybe a better way is to ensure that the greatest common divisor is positive and that the leading term is positive. For example, the line equation can be normalized by dividing by the gcd and then ensuring that the coefficient of x is positive. If the coefficient is zero, then the coefficient of y should be positive.</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "</ol>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, we can represent the line equation in a standardized form. For example, the line equation is written as ax + by = 0. The standard form can be represented by the pair (a, b) in their reduced form (divided by their gcd), and with a positive leading term. If a is zero, then b must be positive. Otherwise, if a is not zero, the sign is adjusted so that a is positive. If a is zero, then b must be positive.</p>\n",
       "<p>For example, the line equation 2x + 4y = 0 can be normalized by dividing by 2 to get (1, 2). The line equation -3x -6y =0 can be divided by -3 to get (1, 2).

       "<p>So the normalization steps are:</p>\n",
       "<p>Given a line equation ax + by =0 (the line passes through the origin and (xi, yi)), the normalized form is computed as follows:</p>\n",
       "<p>Compute g = gcd(a, b).</p>\n",
       "<p>If g is zero, then it's the origin, which is not a valid line. But in our problem, xi and yi are &gt;=1, so a and b can't both be zero.</p>\n",
       "<p>Compute a' = a / g, b' = b / g.</p>\n",
       "<p>Then, if a' == 0:</p>\n",

       "<p>Find the sign of a'. If a' is negative, multiply a' and b' by -1.</p>\n",

       "<p>So for a point (x, y), to check if it lies on the line (xi, yi) and (0,0), we can compute the line equation for the query line, normalize it, and then for each point (x, y) in A, check if it lies on the normalized line.</p>\n",
       "<p>But this requires that for each query line L, we can compute the normalized line equation and then look up how many points in A are on that line.</p>\n",

       "<p>But how to compute this?</p>\n",
       "<p>For each point (x, y) in A, when it is added (type 1 query), we need to compute all possible line equations that pass through the origin and (x, y). Wait, no. The line equations that a point (x, y) lies on are all lines passing through (x, y) and the origin. So for a point (x, y), the line equation is y * x' - x * y' = 0. So the line equation is (y, -x) in the ax + by =0 form. Or wait, the line equation for the line passing through (0,0) and (x, y) is y * x' - x * y' =0. So rearranged, it's y x' - x y' =0 → yx' -xy' =0 → which can be written as (y, -x) · (x', y') =0.</p>\n",
       "<p>So for a point (x, y), the line equations that it lies on are all lines of the form (y, -x) in normalized form.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, no. Each point (x, y) lies on exactly one line passing through the origin. The line is determined by (x, y), and its equation is y<em>x' -x</em>y' =0. So the line equation is (y, -x) in the ax + by =0 form.</p>\n",
       "<p>So for a point (x, y), the line equation is ax + by =0, where a = y, b = -x.</p>\n",
       "<p>But when we normalize this line equation, it's possible that different points (x, y) may lie on the same normalized line.</p>\n",
       "<p>For example, point (2,4) has line equation 4x - 2y =0 → normalized to (2, -1) → but according to the normalization steps, the leading coefficient should be positive. So after dividing by their gcd (which is 2), we get (2/2, -1/2) → (1, -0.5). Wait, but normalization requires that a and b are integers, since we divided by the gcd. So for the line equation (4, -2), which comes from (y, -x) for (x, y) = (2,4), the normalized form would be (2, -1) → wait, the gcd of 4 and -2 is 2. So 4/2 = 2, -2/2 = -1. Then, since the leading coefficient (2) is positive, we can leave it as (2, -1). But according to the normalization steps I proposed earlier, we should divide by the gcd and then ensure that the leading coefficient is positive. But in this case, the leading coefficient (2) is already positive. So the normalized line equation is (2, -1).</p>\n",
       "<p>But another point (1, 2) would have line equation (2, -1), which is the same as the line equation for (2,4). So these two points lie on the same line.</p>\n",
       "<p>Ah, right. So the line equation for (1,2) is 2x -1y =0 → 2x -y =0. The line equation for (2,4) is 4x -2y =0 → 2x - y =0. So both lie on the same line. So their normalized line equations would be (2, -1) and (4, -2), but when normalized, they should become the same. Wait, no. Let's compute the normalized form for the line equation 4x -2y =0.</p>\n",
       "<p>Original line equation coefficients are (4, -2).</p>\n",
       "<p>gcd(4, 2) is 2. So divide by 2: (2, -1). Leading coefficient is 2, which is positive, so no sign change needed. So the normalized form is (2, -1).</p>\n",
       "<p>For the line equation 2x -1y =0, the coefficients are (2, -1). gcd is 1. So the normalized form is (2, -1).</p>\n",
       "<p>Thus, both points (2,4) and (1,2) are on the same line, which has normalized equation (2, -1).</p>\n",
       "<p>So to compute the normalized line equation for a point (x, y), we compute (y, -x), then normalize this pair.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, no. Wait, for a point (x, y), the line passing through the origin and (x, y) is yx' - xy' =0. This can be written as yx' = xy' → y x' -x y' =0. So the line equation is (y, -x) · (x', y') =0. So the coefficients are (y, -x).</p>\n",
       "<p>So for a point (x, y), the line equation is (y, -x), and we need to normalize this pair to find the key in the hash map.</p>\n",
       "<p>So for each point (x, y), when added to A, we compute the normalized form of (y, -x), and increment the count in the hash map for that normalized line. When removed, we decrement the count.</p>\n",

       "<p>Thus, for a type 3 query with line L defined by (xi, yi), the line equation is (yi, -xi) (since the line passes through (0,0) and (xi, yi)). We normalize this pair and look up the count in line_counts.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the count of points on L is line_counts[normalized_line], and S is |A| - this count.</p>\n",
       "<p>But wait, no. Because line_counts is a map from normalized lines to the number of points in A that lie on that line.

       "<p>So for each query type 3, the line L is given. We need to compute the number of points p in A such that p is not on L and q (reflection of p) is in A.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to do this efficiently.</p>\n",
       "<p>Hmm. Let's think of the following approach: For each point p in A, store its coordinates. For a given line L, compute for each p in A (not on L) the reflection q, and check if q is in A. But this is O(n) per query.</p>\n",
       "<p>But with n up to 1e5 and queries up to 1e5, this is O(1e10) operations.</p>\n",

       "<p>Alternative Idea: For each point p in A, we can represent it in a way that allows us to quickly compute, for any line L, whether its reflection q is present in A. But this seems impossible unless we can find a mathematical relationship between p, q, and L.</p>\n",
       "<p>Let me think about the reflection formula again. For a point (x, y) and line L defined by (xi, yi), the reflection (x', y') is:</p>\n",

       "<p>y' = [2*yi(xi x + yi y) - y (xi² + yi²)] / (xi² + yi²)</p>\n",
       "<p>Hmm. Let's factor out (xi² + yi²) from the denominator:</p>\n",
       "<p>x' = [ (2xi^2 x + 2xi yi y - x (xi² + yi²) ) ] / (xi² + yi² )</p>\n",

       "<p>Thus, for points (x, y) not on L, we can compute whether their reflection (x', y') is in A by first checking if the denominators divide the numerators, and then checking if (x', y') is present in A.</p>\n",
       "<p>But this still requires O(n) operations per query, which is not feasible.</p>\n",

       "<p>Alternative Idea: For each pair of points (p, q) in A, compute all possible lines L that are the perpendicular bisectors of p and q. Because for a line L to be the axis of symmetry between p and q, it must be the perpendicular bisector of the segment pq.</p>\n",
       "<p>Thus, for each pair (p, q), the set of lines L that are perpendicular bisectors of pq would be the lines for which the reflection of p across L is q.</p>\n",

       "<p>The idea is to precompute for each pair (p, q) in A the line L that is their mutual reflection line (if it exists and passes through the origin). Then, for each query line L', we can count the number of pairs (p, q) in A where L' is their reflection line.</p>\n",
       "<p>The count of such pairs would be the number of mutual reflections across L', and thus, for each such pair, p and q are in A and their reflections are each other. Thus, each such pair contributes 2 to D (since both p and q are in A and not on L').</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to efficiently compute this for a given L'.</p>\n",
       "<p>But even this approach is challenging, as there are O(n^2) possible pairs, which is 1e10 for n=1e5. So it's not feasible to precompute all pairs.</p>\n",

       "<p>But again, this is not feasible for large n and q.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, what's the alternative? Accept that the solution is O(n) per query, but optimize it as much as possible.</p>\n",

       "<p>Alternatively, maybe the number of possible lines L is limited by the possible (xi, yi) values. For example, if xi and yi are up to 1e5, then the number of possible lines is 1e10, which is way too big.</p>\n",
       "<p>Thus, this is not helpful.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but the line L for a query is defined by (xi, yi) and the origin. So the line can be uniquely determined by the pair (xi, yi). But for the same line, different (xi, yi) pairs may be used. For example, (2, 4) and (1, 2) define the same line.</p>\n",

       "<p>The intersection of A and the image is the set of points in A that are reflections of some other point in A.</p>\n",
       "<p>But to compute the size of this intersection, we need to iterate over all points in A, compute their reflection, and check if the reflection is in A.</p>\n",

       "<p>In Python, each check is O(1), but the reflection computation is a bit time-consuming due to the formula. Let's see:</p>\n",
       "<p>For each point (x, y), and query line (xi, yi), compute the reflection (x', y'):</p>\n",
       "<p>denominator = xi<em>xi + yi</em>yi</p>\n",

       "<p>Thus, there must be a different approach.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, perhaps the problem can be optimized by precomputing for each point (x, y) a hash value and then, for each query line L, compute the hash of the reflection (x', y') and check if it's present. But this requires the same O(n) operations.</p>\n",
       "<p>Thus, I'm stuck. I think I need to code this approach and see if there's a way to optimize it.</p>\n",
       "<p>But given the time constraints, it's not feasible.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, let's look at the sample input 2:</p>\n",
       "<p>6</p>\n",
       "<p>1 1 2</p>\n",
       "<p>3 1 1</p>\n",

       "<p>3 2 2</p>\n",
       "<p>2 1 1</p>\n",
       "<p>3 2 4</p>\n",
       "<p>The output is 1, 1, 0.</p>\n",
       "<p>For the first type 3 query (1,1), the line is y=x.</p>\n",
       "<p>The set A has (1,2). The reflection of (1,2) across y=x is (2,1), which is not in A. So contributes 1. But the line L is (1,1), which is y=x. So the answer is 1.</p>\n",
       "<p>But according to the output, the answer is 1.</p>\n",
       "<p>Then, after adding (1,1), the third query is (2,2). The line is x=y. The set A has (1,2) and (1,1). (1,1) is on the line. (1,2) reflects to (2,1), which is not present. So the answer is 1.</p>\n",
       "<p>Then, after removing (1,1), the third query is (2,4). The line is (2,4), which has equation 4x - 2y =0 → 2x -y =0.</p>\n",
       "<p>The set A has (1,2) and (1,2) is not on the line. Its reflection is computed as:</p>\n",
       "<p>xi=2, yi=4.</p>\n",

       "<p>numer_y = 2<em>4</em>10 -2*20=80-40=40 → y'=40/20=2.</p>\n",
       "<p>So reflection is (1,2). So the point is the same as p. But wait, the line L is (2,4), and the point (1,2) is on the line 2x -y =0 (since 2*1 -2=0). So (1,2) is on L. Thus, it is excluded. So the answer is 0.</p>\n",
       "<p>Thus, the answer is 0.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to compute this.</p>\n",
       "<p>Thus, the answer for a point p in A not on L, and whose reflection is in A, is 0.</p>\n",
       "<p>But in this case, the reflection of (1,2) is (1,2), but since it's on L, it's excluded.</p>\n",
       "<p>Thus, the answer is 0.</p>\n",
       "<p>Thus, the code must handle the case where the reflection of p is in A but is on L.</p>\n",
       "<p>But according to the formula, for a point p not on L, the reflection q is not on L. So this case is impossible.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, the line L is defined by (xi, yi). For a point p not on L, the reflection q is also not on L.</p>\n",
       "<p>Because if q were on L, then p would be the reflection of q across L. But q is on L, so q's reflection is q. Thus, p would be q, which is on L. But p is not on L. Contradiction. Thus, if p is not on L, then q is also not on L.</p>\n",
       "<p>Thus, the code can safely assume that if p is not on L, then q is not on L.</p>\n",
       "<p>Thus, for D, we can safely check if q is in A, regardless of whether q is on L or not.</p>\n",
       "<p>But in this case, the code would have to check if q is in A, but q could be on L. However, since p is not on L, q is not on L.</p>\n",
       "<p>Thus, the code can safely check if q is in A.</p>\n",
       "<p>Thus, for each query, the code:</p>\n",
       "<ol>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>Computes the line L's normalized equation and counts how many points are on L (using line_counts).</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>S = len(A) - on_L_count.</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>For all points in A not on L, compute their reflection q and check if q is in A. Count the number of such points. This is D.</p>\n",

       "<li>\n",
       "<p>The answer is S - D.</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "</ol>\n",
       "<p>Thus, the code must iterate over all points in A, check if they are not on L, compute q, and check if q is in A.</p>\n",
       "<p>But with Python's speed, this is impossible for large n and q.</p>\n",
       "<p>Thus, the intended solution must use a different approach.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but the problem states that the time limit is 6 seconds per test case. Let's see:</p>\n",
       "<p>For 1e5 queries of type 3, each processing 1e5 points, it's 1e10 operations. Even with each operation taking 0.1 nanoseconds (which is impossible), this would take 1 second. But in reality, Python operations take about 1e6 per second. So 1e10 operations would take 1e4 seconds, which is way too slow.</p>\n",
       "<p>Thus, the intended solution must be O(1) per query.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, perhaps the answer is always zero or some other pattern, but the sample inputs contradict this.</p>\n",
       "<p>Thus, I must have missed a key insight.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another Idea: The line L passes through the origin and (xi, yi). For the set to be symmetric with respect to L, every point p in A must have its reflection q in A. The minimal number of points to add is the number of points in A whose reflection is not in A, excluding those on L.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to compute this.</p>\n",
       "<p>But again, this is the same as the answer.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another Idea: For each query line L, the answer is the number of points in A not on L minus the number of points in A whose reflection is also in A.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to compute this.</p>\n",
       "<p>But again, this is the same as before.</p>\n",
       "<p>At this point, I think that the problem requires an O(n) per query approach, and the intended solution is to code this with optimizations, perhaps using bitmasking or other techniques to speed up the computations.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how.</p>\n",
       "<p>An alternative approach is to note that the reflection of a point (x, y) across L is (x', y'), and to check if (x', y') is in A. But in Python, using a set to store the points, and precomputing the reflections, this is possible.</p>\n",
       "<p>But with 1e5 queries, each processing 1e5 points, it's not feasible.</p>\n",
       "<p>But perhaps the number of type 3 queries is small, but according to the problem statement, there can be up to 1e5.</p>\n",
       "<p>Thus, the problem must have a different approach.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another Idea: For a point (x, y) and a query line (xi, yi), the reflection (x', y') is given by the formula. For (x', y') to be in A, it must satisfy:</p>\n",
       "<p>x' = [2xi(xi x + yi y) - x (xi² + yi²)] / (xi² + yi²)</p>\n",
       "<p>y' = [2yi(xi x + yi y) - y (xi² + yi²)] / (xi² + yi²)</p>\n",
       "<p>We can rewrite this as:</p>\n",
       "<p>x' = x * (2xi² - (xi² + yi²)) / (xi² + yi²) + y * (2xi yi) / (xi² + yi²)</p>\n",
       "<p>= x * (xi² - yi²)/(xi² + yi²) + y * (2xi yi)/(xi² + yi²)</p>\n",
       "<p>Similarly for y'.</p>\n",
       "<p>This can be written as:</p>\n",
       "<p>x' = x * (xi² - yi²) + y * 2 xi yi) // denominator</p>\n",
       "<p>y' = x * 2 xi yi + y * ( yi² - xi² ) // denominator</p>\n",
       "<p>Thus, if we precompute the coefficients for xi and yi, then x' and y' can be computed as linear combinations of x and y, divided by the denominator.</p>\n",
       "<p>But this seems not helpful.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another Idea: If xi and yi are such that the denominator divides the numerators for all points in A, then (x', y') are integers, and we can check if they are in A. Otherwise, they are not in A.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to determine if the denominator divides the numerators for a given (xi, yi) and (x, y).</p>\n",
       "<p>But this requires checking for each (x, y) and (xi, yi), which is again O(n) per query.</p>\n",
       "<p>Thus, I'm forced to conclude that there's no way to compute the answer in O(1) or O(log n) per query, and that the intended solution is to use O(n) per query approach, but with optimizations.</p>\n",
       "<p>But given the time constraints, this is only feasible in C++ with fast code.</p>\n",
       "<p>But since the problem is to be solved in Python, which is slower, this approach would not pass.</p>\n",
       "<p>Thus, there must be a mathematical insight that I'm missing.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, perhaps for the reflection of p to be in A, p must be of a certain form.</p>\n",
       "<p>For example, if the line L is the x-axis, then the reflection of (x, y) is (x, -y). But in the problem, all points are positive, so (x, -y) is not a valid point (since y is &gt;=1). Thus, in this case, the reflection is not in A, so the answer is S.</p>\n",
       "<p>But this is a special case.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to generalize this.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another Idea: For a given line L, the reflection of a point (x, y) is in A only if (x', y') is a point that has been added to A and not removed. Thus, for a query line L, if the reflection function produces a point not in A for all points, then the answer is S.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to determine this.</p>\n",
       "<p>But this requires knowing the reflection function's output for all points, which again requires O(n) operations.</p>\n",
       "<p>Thus, I'm stuck.</p>\n",
       "<p>After hours of thinking, I think the intended solution is to proceed with the O(n) per query approach, but use the fastest possible way to compute the reflections and look them up.</p>\n",

Let's think about how to approach this.\\n\\nThe problem says that n can be up to 1e6. Wait, 1e6 isn't that big. But even so, I need an efficient way to convert it to binary. But what's the standard way to do this in Python?\\n\\nHmm, Python has built-in functions for this. Like bin(n), which returns a string starting with '0b', so I can just slice that off. For example, bin(5) gives '0b101', so removing the first two characters gives '101'. That's exactly what the examples show. So for the input 5, output is 101. So using bin() seems straightforward.\\n\\nBut wait, the problem says to output without leading zeros. But bin() automatically doesn't have leading zeros except for the case when n is 0, but since n is a positive integer (as per the problem statement), n can't be zero. So using bin(n)[2:] should give the correct result.\\n\\nSo the code would be something like:\\n\\nn = int(input())\\nprint(bin(n)[2:])\\n\\nThat's really simple. But is there any case where this might not work? Like when n is 1? Let's see. bin(1) is '0b1', so [2:] is '1', which is correct.\\n\\nWhat about edge cases like n=1e6? Let's compute 1e6 in binary. Well, bin(1000000) is '0b11110100001001000000', which when sliced gives the correct binary.\\n\\nThis approach is O(1) time because converting an integer to binary in Python is done efficiently, even for large numbers. Since the maximum n is 1e6, which is manageable, this method should work within the time constraints. The built-in functions are optimized in C, so they're much faster than any manual implementation.\\n\\nAnother approach would be to manually compute the binary digits by dividing n by 2 each time and collecting the remainders. But that's more code and possibly less efficient. For example:\\n\\nres = []\\nwhile n > 0:\\n    res.append(str(n % 2))\\n    n = n // 2\\nres.reverse()\\nprint(''.join(res))\\n\\nBut this would also work and has O(log n) time complexity, which is acceptable. But why write all that code when Python's built-in does it more efficiently?\\n\\nSo the optimal approach is to use bin() and slice off the first two characters. It's the fastest and most memory-efficient way.

Let's think about how to approach this.\\n\\nThe problem says that n can be up to 1e6. Wait, 1e6 isn't that big. But even so, I need an efficient way to convert it to binary. But what's the standard way to do this in Python?\\n\\nHmm, Python has built-in functions for this. Like bin(n), which returns a string starting with '0b', so I can just slice that off. For example, bin(5) gives '0b101', so removing the first two characters gives '101'. That's exactly what the examples show. So for the input 5, output is 101. So using bin() seems straightforward.\\n\\nBut wait, the problem says to output without leading zeros. But bin() automatically doesn't have leading zeros except for the case when n is 0, but since n is a positive integer (as per the problem statement), n can't be zero. So using bin(n)[2:] should give the correct result.\\n\\nSo the code would be something like:\\n\\nn = int(input())\\nprint(bin(n)[2:])\\n\\nThat's really simple. But is there any case where this might not work? Like when n is 1? Let's see. bin(1) is '0b1', so [2:] is '1', which is correct.\\n\\nWhat about edge cases like n=1e6? Let's compute 1e6 in binary. Well, bin(1000000) is '0b11110100001001000000', which when sliced gives the correct binary.\\n\\nThis approach is O(1) time because converting an integer to binary in Python is done efficiently, even for large numbers. Since the maximum n is 1e6, which is manageable, this method should work within the time constraints. The built-in functions are optimized in C, so they're much faster than any manual implementation.\\n\\nAnother approach would be to manually compute the binary digits by dividing n by 2 each time and collecting the remainders. But that's more code and possibly less efficient. For example:\\n\\nres = []\\nwhile n > 0:\\n    res.append(str(n % 2))\\n    n = n // 2\\nres.reverse()\\nprint(''.join(res))\\n\\nBut this would also work and has O(log n) time complexity, which is acceptable. But why write all that code when Python's built-in does it more efficiently?\\n\\nSo the optimal approach is to use bin() and slice off the first two characters. It's the fastest and most memory-efficient way. The code is straightforward and will handle all test cases within the constraints.\\n\\nTesting the examples:\\n\\nFor input 5: bin(5)[2:] → '101', correct.\\n\\nFor input 13: bin(13)[2:] → '1101', correct.\\n\\nSo the code should work.\\n</think>\\n\\n```python\\nn = int(input())\\nprint(bin(n)[2:])\\n```\", 'role': 'assistant'}], 'verification_result': {'expected': None, 'got': None, 'input': None, 'passed_all': True, 'reason': 'All tests passed', 'stderr': None}}\n",

We need to find two integers x and y such that l ≤ x < y ≤ r, and their LCM is between l and r inclusive. If not possible, output -1 -1.\\n\\nFirst, the problem examples give some clues. For instance, in the third test case (2 4), the answer is 2 and 4. Their LCM is 4, which is within the range. So in that case, choosing consecutive even numbers might be a good idea.\\n\\nHmm. Let's think about when it's possible. The key is to find x and y where LCM(x,y) is ≤ r. Because if x and y are both ≤ r, then their LCM must be ≤ r * (y-1) or something, but that's not helpful. Wait, wait. The LCM of x and y is the smallest number divisible by both. So LCM(x,y) is at least max(x,y), since the maximum of x and y is already a multiple of itself. But since y > x (since x < y), then LCM(x,y) ≥ y. But since y ≤ r, the LCM must be ≥ y. So the LCM needs to be between l and r. But wait, the LCM is at least y, which is at least x+1 (since x < y). So for the LCM to be ≤ r, we need y ≤ r. But y is already ≤ r. So the real constraint is that LCM(x,y) ≤ r.\\n\\nSo how can we find x and y such that their LCM is ≤ r? The minimal possible LCM is when x and y are such that one divides the other. For example, if y is a multiple of x. Then LCM(x,y) = y. So in this case, if y is ≤ r, then the LCM is exactly y. So if we can find such a pair where y is between l and r, then the LCM is y, which is within the required range.\\n\\nSo the strategy could be: look for two consecutive even numbers, or a number and its double, but perhaps the simplest approach is to check if there exists a pair where one is a multiple of the other. For example, x and y where y is 2x. But perhaps even simpler: check if there is a pair x and 2x where 2x is ≤ r. If that's possible, then LCM(x, 2x) is 2x, which is ≤ r. So if l ≤ x < 2x ≤ r, then x and 2x would be a valid pair.\\n\\nWait, but how to find x such that 2x is ≤ r and x ≥ l. So x can be as low as l, but 2x has to be ≤ r. So the maximum x in this case is r//2. So if l <= r//2, then x can be l, and y = 2*l. Then LCM is 2*l. And we need to check if this LCM is >= l (which it is) and <= r. So as long as 2*l <= r, then x = l and y = 2*l would work. Because LCM(l, 2l) = 2l. So for example, if the input is 2 4, then 2*2=4 <=4, so LCM is 4 which is within 2 and 4.\\n\\nSo in this case, if 2*l <= r, then the answer is l and 2*l. Because x < y (since l < 2l when l is at least 1), and LCM is 2l which is <=r.\\n\\nBut wait, in the third test case of the example (2 4), 2*2=4, which is equal to r. So that's acceptable. So if 2*l <= r, then output l and 2*l.\\n\\nBut what if l is such that 2*l > r? Then that approach wouldn't work. For example, in the case where l is 3 and r is 5. Then 2*3=6>5, so we can't do that. So in that case, we need another approach.\\n\\nAlternatively, if there's any even number between l and r. For example, if there are two consecutive numbers where one is even. Let's think: take x and x+1. Their LCM is x*(x+1) if they are coprime, but that's probably larger than r. So that's not useful unless x and x+1 are small. But for larger l and r, x and x+1 would be large, making their LCM possibly exceed r.\\n\\nHmm. So perhaps the best approach is to check if there's a pair where one is a multiple of the other. If that exists, then return that pair. Otherwise, check other possibilities.\\n\\nBut how to check this efficiently.\\n\\nAnother approach: if there exists any x in [l, r] such that 2x <= r. Then x and 2x is a valid pair. So the minimal x is l, and 2x must be <=r. So if l*2 <=r, then the answer is l and 2l.\\n\\nSo in the first example input:\\n\\nTest case 1: l=1, r=1337. Then 1*2=2 <=1337. So the answer is 1 and 2. But the sample output is 6 and 7. Wait, that's conflicting. Oh, wait. Wait, no. The sample output for the first test case is 6 7. Hmm. But according to this logic, why isn't 1 and 2 the answer? Because their LCM is 2, which is between 1 and 1337. So why isn't that the case?\\n\\nWait, the problem requires that x and y satisfy l ≤ x < y ≤r, and LCM(x,y) is between l and r. But the LCM in this case (1,2) is 2, which is between 1 and 1337. So why isn't that the answer? The sample output for the first test case is 6 7. But according to this approach, there's a valid pair. So perhaps the sample is wrong. Wait, no. Let me check the sample input again.\\n\\nWait the sample input for the first test case is 1 and 1337. The output is 6 7. So LCM(6,7) is 42, which is between 1 and 1337. So that's a valid pair. But according to the logic of x and 2x, 1 and 2 is also a valid pair. So why isn't that the answer? Because the problem allows any valid pair, but the code can output any of them. So the sample output is just one possible solution.\\n\\nBut in that case, why does the sample output not choose the minimal x and y? Because perhaps the code's approach was to pick x and x+1 when possible. But in any case, the problem allows any valid pair.\\n\\nSo perhaps the initial approach of checking if 2*l <= r is the way to go. Because that would give a valid pair.\\n\\nSo for any test case where 2*l <= r, the answer would be l and 2*l.\\n\\nBut wait, the first sample input's l is 1, 2*l is 2. So the pair (1,2) would have LCM 2. Which is valid. So why isn't that the answer in the sample output? Because the sample output is 6 7, which is another valid pair. But the problem states that any valid pair is acceptable.\\n\\nSo perhaps the sample is just showing another possible solution. So the code can output any pair as long as it's valid.\\n\\nSo the key insight is that if 2*l <= r, then the pair (l, 2*l) is valid. So that's a very quick check, and can be done in O(1) per test case. But what about cases where 2*l > r? For example, the third sample input is 2 4. 2*2=4 is equal to r, so the pair (2,4) is valid.\\n\\nBut in the case where l is 3 and r is 5: 3*2=6>5. So we can't do that. So we need to find another pair.\\n\\nIn such cases, perhaps we can look for consecutive even numbers, like 3 and 4. LCM(3,4) is 12, which is larger than 5. So that's no good.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the pair (3,5). LCM(15) which is 15, which is larger than 5. No.\\n\\nHmm. So in this case, the answer is impossible. So how to handle cases where 2*l > r.\\n\\nAnother example: l=88, r=89 (the last test case in the sample). So possible pairs are 88 and 89. LCM is 88*89 = 7832, which is way bigger than r (89). So no pair exists. So output -1 -1.\\n\\nSo what's the condition when there's no solution?\\n\\nIf for all pairs x < y in [l, r], the LCM(x,y) is > r. So when is that possible?\\n\\nThe LCM of x and y is at least y (since y is a multiple of x's divisor). So the minimal possible LCM is y. So for the LCM to be <= r, y must be <= r, which it already is. But LCM is y only if x divides y. So if there's no pair x < y where x divides y, then the LCM of x and y will be at least the minimal multiple that's divisible by both, which could be greater than r.\\n\\nSo how to find such a pair when 2*l > r.\\n\\nWait, but if 2*l > r, then l and r are consecutive numbers. For example, l=3, r=5. Then possible pairs are (3,4), (3,5), (4,5).\\n\\nTheir LCMs are:\\n\\n3 and4:12>5.\\n\\n3 and5:15>5.\\n\\n4 and5:20>5.\\n\\nSo output is -1 -1.\\n\\nBut how to find a valid pair when possible.\\n\\nAnother example: l=5, r=6.\\n\\nPossible pairs: (5,6). LCM is 30>6. So output is -1-1.\\n\\nAnother example: l=4, r=5. Pair (4,5) LCM is 20>5. No solution.\\n\\nWait, but what if the pair is (4,5). LCM is 20>5. So no.\\n\\nHmm.\\n\\nSo when 2*l > r, the only possible pairs are consecutive numbers. But their LCM is x*(x+1) if they are coprime, which would be larger than r.\\n\\nSo in such cases, the only possible way to have LCM(x,y) <= r is if y is a multiple of x, but since x >= l, and y =x *k. But since 2x > r, then x must be larger than r/2. So y would be x *2, but x is at least r/2 +1 (since x >= l and l > r/2). So x*2 would be larger than r. So there's no possible multiple.\\n\\nSo in this case, the answer is impossible.\\n\\nThus, the conclusion is: if 2*l <= r, then there exists a pair (l, 2*l) which is valid. Otherwise, check if there's any pair where one is a multiple of the other. But if 2*l > r, then even the minimal possible multiple (x*2) would be larger than r, so no possible pairs. Hence, in such cases, the answer is -1-1.\\n\\nWait, but wait. What if l=3, r=6. Then 2*3=6 <=6. So the pair (3,6) has LCM 6 which is between 3 and 6. So output 3 6.\\n\\nYes. So the condition is if 2*l <= r, then output l and 2*l. Otherwise, check if there exists any pair x, y where y is a multiple of x. But when 2*l > r, it's possible that l is 5 and r is 10. Then 2*5=10, which is <=10. So the pair (5,10) is valid.\\n\\nWait, but in that case, 2*l is 10, which equals r. So the condition 2*l <= r is satisfied. So the code would output 5 and 10.\\n\\nSo the initial approach of checking 2*l <= r seems sufficient.\\n\\nSo the algorithm could be:\\n\\nFor each test case:\\n\\n- if 2*l <= r: output l and 2*l.\\n\\n- else: check if there exists any x and y in [l, r] where x < y and LCM(x,y) <= r.\\n\\nBut when 2*l > r, then the possible x and y must be such that y is a multiple of x and y <= r.\\n\\nBut since x >= l, and y is a multiple of x (>= x*2), but x*2 >= 2*l. But 2*l > r, so x*2 > r. Hence, y can't be a multiple of x. So in such cases, there are no possible pairs. Hence, output -1-1.\\n\\nWait, but wait. Let's take l=3, r=5. Then 2*3=6>5. So according to the initial approach, we output -1-1. Which is correct.\\n\\nAnother example: l=5, r=10. 2*5=10 <=10. So output 5 and 10.\\n\\nSo the initial approach seems correct.\\n\\nSo the steps for each test case:\\n\\nCheck if 2*l <= r. If yes, output l and 2*l.\\n\\nElse, check if there exists any pair (x, x+1) where their LCM is <= r. But how?\\n\\nWait, when 2*l > r, but l and r are consecutive. For example, l=3, r=4. Then possible pairs are (3,4). LCM is 12>4. So no.\\n\\nAnother example: l=2, r=3. 2*2=4>3. So check if any pairs. (2,3) has LCM 6>3. So output -1-1.\\n\\nBut wait, in the sample input's third test case, l=2, r=4. 2*2=4<=4. So output 2 and4.\\n\\nSo the initial approach works.\\n\\nBut the sample input's first test case: l=1, r=1337. 2*1=2 <=1337. So output 1 and 2. But the sample output is 6 and7.\\n\\nBut according to the problem statement, any valid pair is acceptable. So why does the sample output choose a different pair? Because the code can output any valid pair, and 1 and 2 is a valid pair. So why isn't that the sample's answer?\\n\\nWait, looking at the sample input's first output line: 6 7. The LCM is 6*7=42 (since they are coprime). Which is between 1 and 1337. So that's valid. But according to the approach of outputting l and 2*l, the answer would be 1 and 2. So why isn't that the sample's output? Because the problem allows any pair. So perhaps the sample's answer is just one possible solution, and the code can output any pair.\\n\\nSo the initial approach of checking if 2*l <= r would output a valid pair. Hence, the code can be written as:\\n\\nFor each test case:\\n\\nIf 2*l <= r: output l and 2*l.\\n\\nElse: output -1 -1.\\n\\nBut wait, there's a case where 2*l > r, but there's another pair that works.\\n\\nWait, let's take l=3 and r=6. 2*3=6 <=6. So output 3 and6.\\n\\nAnother example: l=4, r=6. 2*4=8>6. So according to the code, output -1-1. But possible pairs are (4,6). LCM is 12>6. So no. So code is correct.\\n\\nAnother case: l=3, r=7. 2*3=6<=7. Output 3,6. Which is valid.\\n\\nBut what if l=5 and r=10. 2*5=10 <=10. Output 5 and10.\\n\\nBut what if l=5 and r=9. Then 2*5=10>9. So code would output -1-1. But possible pairs? For example, 5 and 6. LCM is 30>9. No. 6 and 8: LCM is 24>9. So no. So code is correct.\\n\\nSo in all cases, the code would output a valid pair if 2*l <= r, else -1-1. Because when 2*l > r, there are no possible pairs where one is a multiple of the other, and other pairs have LCMs that are larger than r.\\n\\nBut wait, is there a case where 2*l > r but there exists a pair where LCM is <= r?\\n\\nLet's think. Suppose l=6, r=10. 2*6=12>10. So code says output -1-1. But possible pairs:\\n\\n6 and 9: LCM is 18>10. No.\\n\\n6 and 8: LCM 24>10.\\n\\n7 and 8: LCM 56>10.\\n\\nNo pairs. So code is correct.\\n\\nAnother example: l=3, r=7. 2*3=6<=7. So code outputs 3 and6.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnother example: l=7, r=14. 2*7=14 <=14. So code outputs 7 and14. LCM is 14, which is between 7 and14.\\n\\nSo correct.\\n\\nSo this approach seems to cover all possible valid cases.\\n\\nThus, the code can be written as:\\n\\nFor each test case, read l and r.\\n\\nIf l *2 <= r:\\n\\n    print l and 2*l.\\n\\nElse:\\n\\n    print -1 -1.\\n\\nBut wait, let's look at the sample input's third test case:\\n\\nInput is 2 4. So l=2, r=4. 2*2=4 <=4. So code outputs 2 and4. Which matches the sample.\\n\\nSample input's fourth test case: 88 89. 88*2=176>89. So code outputs -1-1. Which matches the sample.\\n\\nThe second sample input is 13 69. 13*2=26 <=69. So code outputs 13 and26. But sample output is 14 and21. So why the discrepancy?\\n\\nWait, the sample output for the second test case is 14 21. Their LCM is LCM(14,21) = 42, which is between 13 and69. So it's a valid pair. But according to the code, the output is 13 and26, which also have LCM 26, which is between 13 and69. So the code's answer is correct. The sample is just another valid pair.\\n\\nThus, the code's approach is correct.\\n\\nTherefore, the solution is to check if 2*l <=r. If yes, output l and 2*l. Else, output -1-1.\\n\\nThus, the code can be written as:\\n\\nRead t test cases.\\n\\nFor each test case:\\n\\nl, r = map(int, input().split())\\n\\nif 2 * l <= r:\\n\\n    print(l, 2*l)\\n\\nelse:\\n\\n    print(-1, -1)\\n\\nBut wait, there's a possible edge case when l is 0. But according to the problem statement, the constraints are 1 ≤ l < r ≤1e9. So l is at least 1.\\n\\nThus, the code is correct.\\n\\nNow, let's test some cases.\\n\\nTest case where l=2, r=3. 2*2=4>3. So output -1-1. Correct.\\n\\nTest case l=3, r=6: 3*2=6<=6. Output 3 6.\\n\\nAnother test case: l=5, r=5. But the input is l < r. So no.\\n\\nAnother case l=1, r=2. Output 1 and 2. Which is correct.\\n\\nSo the code should work.\\n\\nThus, the code is as follows.\\n</think>\\n\\n```python\\nimport sys\\n\\nt = int(sys.stdin.readline())\\nfor _ in range(t):\\n    l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\\n    if 2 * l <= r:\\n        print(l, 2 * l)\\n    else:\\n        print(-1, -1)\\n```\", '<think>\\nOkay, let\\'s see. The problem is to determine whether a given set of N qubits (N between 2 and 8) is in the GHZ state or the W state. We need to perform operations and measurements to figure out which one it is. The answer should return 0 for GHZ and 1 for W.\\n\\nHmm, so first, I need to remember the properties of the GHZ and W states. Let\\'s think about their structures.\\n\\nThe GHZ state is a superposition of all 0s and all 1s. So when measured in the computational basis, all qubits will be the same. So if we measure each qubit, they either all collapse to 0 or all to 1. But since it\\'s a superposition, each possibility has a 50% chance. So if we check all qubits after a single measurement, they should all be the same. But how can we use this?\\n\\nThe W state is a uniform superposition of all states with exactly one 1 and the rest 0s. So when measured, exactly one qubit will be 1, the others 0. But since it\\'s a symmetric state, each qubit has an equal probability of being the 1. So for each qubit, the probability of being 1 is 1/N. So when we measure all qubits, there will be exactly one 1 in the outcome.\\n\\nSo the key difference is: for GHZ state, all qubits are same (all 0 or all 1) upon measurement. For W state, exactly one qubit is 1, others 0.\\n\\nBut wait, when you measure the GHZ state, after measurement, all qubits will collapse to the same state. So the measurement outcomes would all be 0 or all 1. So if after measuring all qubits, they are either all 0 or all 1, then it\\'s GHZ. Otherwise, if exactly one is 1, it\\'s W. But what if there\\'s some other combination? Like two 1s. Then that can\\'t happen in either case. So in that case, perhaps the algorithm can return either, but since the input is guaranteed to be either GHZ or W, any outcome that\\'s not all same or exactly one 1 must not be possible. Wait, but the problem states that the input is guaranteed to be one of the two. So when we perform a measurement, if the result is all 0s or all 1s, then it\\'s GHZ. If exactly one 1, it\\'s W. But what if, for example, in the GHZ state, when you measure, you get all 0s. Then you know it\\'s GHZ. But if you get all 1s, same. However, in the W state, any measurement outcome must have exactly one 1. So the approach would be to measure all qubits. If all are same, return 0. Else, if exactly one is 1, return 1.\\n\\nWait, but how can that be? Because in the W state, when measured, you must get exactly one 1. So if after measurement, that\\'s the case, then it\\'s W. Otherwise, it\\'s GHZ. But wait, when you measure the GHZ state, there\\'s a 50% chance of all 0s and 50% all 1s. So any other outcome (like some 0s and some 1s) is impossible. So in that case, the measurement outcome directly tells us the answer.\\n\\nSo the algorithm could be: measure all qubits. If all are 0 or all are 1 → GHZ. Otherwise, check if exactly one is 1 → W.\\n\\nBut how do we check that in the quantum code? Because once we measure the qubits, their state collapses. But in the problem, the input state is either GHZ or W, so any outcome not allowed by the state\\'s possible measurements can\\'t happen.\\n\\nSo the approach is to measure each qubit. If all measurements are 0 → GHZ. All 1 → GHZ. Otherwise, check if exactly one is 1 → then W.\\n\\nBut the problem is that the measurement could return a mix, which would indicate GHZ is not possible. So the algorithm can be:\\n\\n- Measure all qubits once.\\n\\n- If all are same → return 0 (GHZ).\\n\\n- Else, if exactly one is 1 → return 1 (W).\\n\\nBut wait, how can that happen? Because if the state is GHZ, then the measurement can\\'t have a mix. So in that case, any mix would imply it\\'s W. But in the W state, the only possible measurement outcome is exactly one 1. So if the measurement result has exactly one 1, it\\'s W. Otherwise, it\\'s impossible. Wait, no. Wait, the W state allows exactly one 1. So if after measurement, you have two 1s, that\\'s impossible. But the problem states that the input is guaranteed to be either GHZ or W. So when that happens, which state is it? Well, it\\'s impossible. But according to the problem statement, the input is always either GHZ or W. So in reality, such a case (like two 1s) cannot occur. So maybe the algorithm can just check for the GHZ condition first, and if not, assume it\\'s W.\\n\\nSo the steps would be:\\n\\n1. Measure all qubits.\\n\\n2. If all are 0 or all are 1 → return 0.\\n\\n3. Else → return 1.\\n\\nBecause for the W state, the only possible outcome is exactly one 1, which would not be all same. So the code can be written as: after measuring, check if all bits are same. If yes, GHZ. Otherwise, W.\\n\\nBut wait, suppose in the W state, after measurement, exactly one qubit is 1. Then the other N-1 are 0. So the all-same check would fail (since most are 0, one is 1). So in that case, the code returns 1.\\n\\nFor GHZ state, after measurement, all are same. So code returns 0.\\n\\nSo this approach would work.\\n\\nBut how to implement this in Q#?\\n\\nIn Q#, to measure the qubits, we can use M(q) for each qubit in the array. Then collect the results and check.\\n\\nSo for example:\\n\\noperation Solve (qs : Qubit[]) : Int {\\n    // measure all qubits\\n    mutable result = 0;\\n    let measurements = ForEach(M, qs);\\n    let first = measurements[0];\\n    mutable allSame = true;\\n    for m in measurements {\\n        if m != first {\\n            set allSame = false;\\n        }\\n    }\\n    if allSame {\\n        return 0;\\n    } else {\\n        return 1;\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nWait, but wait. Let\\'s think again. For the W state, the measurement will result in exactly one 1. So when we take the measurements, exactly one is 1. So the code will check if all are same. Since one is 1 and others are 0, allSame is false, so return 1.\\n\\nFor the GHZ state, the measurements are all 0 or all 1. So allSame is true, return 0.\\n\\nYes, that seems correct.\\n\\nBut is there any case where this approach could fail?\\n\\nHmm, for example, if the GHZ state is measured as all 0 or all 1. So the code works.\\n\\nBut wait, the problem statement says that the input is guaranteed to be one of the two states. So the code doesn\\'t have to handle any other cases. So this approach is correct.\\n\\nTherefore, the solution is to measure all qubits, check if all are the same. If yes, GHZ (return 0). Else, W (return 1).\\n\\nBut wait, in Q#, when you measure a qubit, you get a Result which is either Zero or One. So in the code, the measurements are stored in a list of Results. So the code checks if all are the same as the first measurement.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nSo this is the correct approach.\\n\\nNow, the code for Q# is as I wrote.\\n\\nBut the problem is to translate this into Python, but the original problem is in Q#. Wait, no. Wait, the user provided a Q# code skeleton and wants a Python solution? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the code should be written in Q#, as per the signature given. But the user is asking for a Python solution. Wait, the problem statement says that the code must read from input and write to output. But the problem seems to be a quantum computing problem. Hmm, wait, perhaps there\\'s a mistake here.\\n\\nWait, the problem says that you have to implement an operation in Q#, but the user\\'s solution requires Python. That\\'s conflicting. Wait, perhaps the problem description is incorrect. Let me re-read the problem statement.\\n\\nThe problem says:\\n\\nYour code should have the following signature:\\n\\nnamespace Solution {\\n    open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;\\n    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;\\n    operation Solve (qs : Qubit[]) : Int\\n    {\\n        body\\n        {\\n            // your code here\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nBut the user says that the solution must read input from standard input and write output to standard output, using Python\\'s print() and input(). But this is impossible because the problem is a quantum computing problem. This is conflicting.\\n\\nWait, perhaps there\\'s a mistake here. The original problem is probably from a Quantum Computing competition (like Microsoft\\'s Q# coding contests), but the user is now asking for a Python solution. But the problem is impossible to solve in Python, because Python cannot simulate quantum operations. So this must be a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the user is confused and the actual problem is to simulate this in a classical way.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps this is a mistake in the problem statement, and the user intended to ask for a classical algorithm that can distinguish between the two states based on measurement outcomes.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a code submission in Q#, but the user is asking for an explanation and code in Python. But that\\'s not possible.\\n\\nWait, the problem\\'s input says None, output says None. So perhaps the actual problem is not to read any input, but to write the Q# code. But the user is now asking for Python code that reads from input and writes to output. That\\'s conflicting.\\n\\nThis suggests that there\\'s a mix-up in the problem statement.\\n\\nBut given that the user provided a code snippet for Q# and requires a Python solution, perhaps this is a mistake, and the actual problem is to write code in Q#. But the user\\'s instructions are conflicting.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps this is a problem from a quantum programming contest, but the user wants to see an explanation and code in Python. But that\\'s impossible.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a classical simulation of the quantum scenario. But how?\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to return 0 if the state is GHZ and 1 if it\\'s W, based on measurement outcomes. The solution would be to perform measurements in a certain way to determine the state with high probability.\\n\\nBut in the problem statement, the code must return the correct answer with certainty. Because the problem states that the input is guaranteed to be one of the two states. So the solution must correctly distinguish them with 100% accuracy.\\n\\nThe approach I outlined earlier (measure all qubits, check if all same) does exactly that. Because for GHZ, measuring all qubits gives all same. For W, the measurements are exactly one 1. So the code would return the correct answer.\\n\\nBut wait, what if in the W state, after measurement, you have exactly one 1. Then the code returns 1. Correct.\\n\\nIn the GHZ state, you get all 0s or all 1s. Then code returns 0. Correct.\\n\\nSo this approach works.\\n\\nTherefore, the code in Q# would be as I wrote. But the user is asking for a Python solution, which is impossible. Unless this is a code submission for a problem that simulates this scenario.\\n\\nWait, perhaps the problem is being presented in a way where the Python code is supposed to model the quantum operations. But this is not standard. Alternatively, perhaps there\\'s a misunderstanding here. But the user\\'s problem is from a quantum programming competition, but they are asking for a Python solution, which is impossible. Unless the Python code is supposed to simulate the quantum state and the measurement process.\\n\\nBut that\\'s not feasible for N up to 8, given the time constraints. For example, simulating the quantum state would require handling 2^8=256 amplitudes. But the problem\\'s time limit is 1 second, and the code must process the largest possible test case (N=8). But in Python, even for N=8, simulating the state is possible, but perhaps the code is supposed to find a way to determine the state without simulation.\\n\\nBut how?\\n\\nWait, the problem is to determine whether the given state is GHZ or W. The Python code is to read input and output 0 or 1. But since there is no input, the code must somehow model the quantum operations. But this is impossible unless the code is a classical simulation of the quantum process.\\n\\nBut the user\\'s problem says that the code must read from input and write to output. But the input is None, according to the problem\\'s input format.\\n\\nThis is very confusing. It\\'s possible that there\\'s a mistake in the problem statement. Perhaps the user intended to present a quantum problem but by mistake replaced the code template with a Python one. Alternatively, the problem is a classical one that mirrors the quantum problem.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a classical problem where the input is a list of qubits\\' states, but this is not clear.\\n\\nBut given that the problem statement mentions the GHZ and W states, which are quantum states, it\\'s likely that the original problem is intended to be solved using quantum operations (i.e., in Q#). However, the user has erroneously asked for a Python solution. But since the problem requires quantum operations, a Python solution is not feasible. Unless the code is intended to output 0 or 1 based on some classical calculation.\\n\\nBut this is impossible to determine without clarification.\\n\\nBut perhaps the user made a mistake and the correct code is in Q#, and the Python code block is a formatting error. However, given the user\\'s instructions, they expect a Python solution.\\n\\nThis is a contradiction.\\n\\nAssuming that the user intended to ask for a Q# solution, but in the problem statement\\'s code block, the code is written in Python, perhaps the correct approach is to write the Q# code as per the problem statement.\\n\\nBut the user\\'s instructions are conflicting. The problem statement\\'s code is in Q#, but the user is asking for Python code. There\\'s a mistake here. Therefore, perhaps the user intended to present a classical problem, but described it in terms of quantum states.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps this is a problem where the solution is to return 0 or 1 based on a specific condition that can be determined classically. For example, the number of 1s in the measured qubits.\\n\\nBut given that the problem is to distinguish between the two quantum states, the solution is to measure all qubits and check if they are all the same.\\n\\nSo in Python, perhaps the code is supposed to read the measurement outcomes and return 0 or 1 accordingly. But since there\\'s no input, how can that be?\\n\\nThis is very unclear. But given the problem\\'s input and output format, which are None, perhaps the code is supposed to be a function that simulates the quantum measurement process. But again, in Python, this would be challenging.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to determine the minimum number of measurements required to distinguish the two states, and the Python code is to output 0 or 1 based on some calculation. But without any input, this is not possible.\\n\\nGiven this confusion, I think there\\'s a mistake in the problem statement. The user probably intended to present a quantum problem to be solved in Q#, but the code block is Python. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a classical problem where the code has to determine the state based on certain parameters. But without input, this is impossible.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the user has mixed up two different problems. For example, the problem\\'s description is for a quantum problem, but the code submission is for a classical problem, which reads input and outputs 0 or 1. But how?\\n\\nIn any case, given the user\\'s instructions to write a Python solution that reads from input and writes to output, and given the problem\\'s description, perhaps the problem is to simulate the quantum measurement process and determine the correct answer.\\n\\nBut how can we simulate the quantum state in Python?\\n\\nThe GHZ state is a superposition of all 0s and all 1s. When measured, all qubits will be in 0 or all in 1, each with 50% probability.\\n\\nThe W state is a superposition of all states with exactly one 1. When measured, exactly one qubit is 1, others are 0, with each such state having equal probability.\\n\\nSo, to simulate the measurement process, the Python code would generate a random measurement outcome based on the actual state (GHZ or W), and then determine which state it was. But since the code is supposed to return 0 or 1 based on the actual state, which is not known to the code, this approach is impossible.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to write a function that, given a quantum state (either GHZ or W), can be measured to determine which it is, and return 0 or 1 accordingly.\\n\\nBut again, the code must process no input, as per the problem\\'s input format.\\n\\nThis is very confusing. Given the conflicting information, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem statement, and the correct solution is the Q# code as outlined earlier.\\n\\nBut since the user insists on a Python solution that reads input and writes output, perhaps this is a mistake, and the correct approach is to write the Q# code as described.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to return 0 or 1 based on the number of 1s in the measured qubits. For example, in the GHZ state, the number of 1s is either 0 or N, while in the W state, it\\'s exactly 1.\\n\\nBut in Python, how would the code know which state it is, given that there is no input? The problem states that the code must return 0 or 1 based on the state, but without any input, this is impossible.\\n\\nGiven all this confusion, I think there\\'s a mistake in the problem statement, and the correct solution is the Q# code I described earlier. However, since the user is asking for Python code, perhaps this is a mistake and the intended solution is to return 0 or 1 based on the measurement outcome.\\n\\nBut in Python, there\\'s no way to interact with quantum states. So perhaps the problem is to generate a classical simulation, where the code uses random numbers to simulate the measurement outcomes of either state and then determines which state it is.\\n\\nBut even this requires knowing which state is being simulated, which is not possible.\\n\\nIn conclusion, given the problem\\'s description, the correct solution is to measure all qubits and check if they are all the same. If yes, return 0 (GHZ), else return 1 (W). The Q# code for this is as follows:\\n\\noperation Solve (qs : Qubit[]) : Int {\\n    mutable isGhz = true;\\n    let m0 = M(qs[0]);\\n    for q in qs {\\n        if M(q) != m0 {\\n            set isGhz = false;\\n        }\\n    }\\n    return isGhz ? 0 | 1;\\n}\\n\\nBut the user\\'s instructions require a Python solution, which is impossible for a quantum problem. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem statement. Perhaps the user intended to provide a classical problem, but it\\'s presented as a quantum one.\\n\\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the correct way to proceed is to provide the Q# code as the solution, as per the problem\\'s original code template, even though the user\\'s instructions ask for Python. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a classical one that\\'s inspired by the quantum scenario.\\n\\nAssuming that the problem is a classical problem where the code must determine whether the given qubits are in GHZ or W state based on certain measurements, but without any input. But how?\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to output 0 or 1 based on some computation that can be done classically, such as checking parity or the number of 1s in the measured outcomes.\\n\\nBut I\\'m stuck. Given the time constraints, I think the correct approach is to provide the Q# code that measures all qubits and returns 0 if all are same, else 1. However, the user\\'s instructions require Python code. Therefore, this is a contradiction.\\n\\nGiven that the user\\'s problem is to write Python code, perhaps they made a mistake and the code should be in Q#. But the user\\'s instruction says to provide Python code. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to be a classical simulation, and the code must output 0 or 1 based on a measurement simulation.\\n\\nBut since there is no input, the code would need to generate a measurement outcome based on one of the two states and then return the answer. But that\\'s impossible because the code is supposed to determine which state it is, not generate a measurement.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to return 0 or 1 with probabilities that allow distinguishing the two states. But the problem requires the code to return the correct answer with certainty.\\n\\nIn summary, the correct solution to the quantum problem is to measure all qubits and check if they are all same, which gives 0 for GHZ and 1 for W. The corresponding Q# code is as described. However, the user\\'s instructions for Python code are conflicting. Therefore, assuming that the user made a mistake and intended to ask for Q# code, but provided a Python code template, the solution is as follows.\\n</think>\\n\\n```python\\n# The problem is inherently quantum and requires a Q# solution. However, due to the user\\'s request for Python code and possible confusion in the problem statement, providing a classical simulation is not feasible. The correct Q# approach is to measure all qubits and check if they are all the same.

Let's think through how to approach this.\\n\\nFirst, the goal is to minimize the absolute difference between the sums of the two groups. Let's start by calculating the total sum of numbers from 1 to n. The total sum S is n*(n+1)/2. The problem then reduces to finding a subset of these numbers whose sum is as close as possible to S/2. Because if one group's sum is as close to S/2 as possible, the other group's sum will also be close, and their difference will be minimized.\\n\\nSo the optimal difference is either 0 (if S is even and such a subset exists) or 1 (if S is odd). Wait, but maybe even when S is even, it's possible that the sum can't reach exactly S/2. But given that the numbers are 1 to n, which is a consecutive sequence, there's probably a way to split them when possible.\\n\\nLet's think about the parity of the sum. The sum S is n(n+1)/2. If S is even, then we can split into two subsets with sum S/2 each, leading to a difference of 0. If S is odd, the best possible is a difference of 1.\\n\\nBut how to find such a subset?\\n\\nLet's consider when S is even. We need to find a subset with sum S/2. For example, in the first sample input where n=4, the total sum is 10, which is even. The required subset sum is 5. The sample solution uses 1 and 4, which adds to 5. Similarly, 2 and 3 would also work.\\n\\nSo the key is to find such a subset. How can we do this efficiently for large n (up to 60,000)?\\n\\nA dynamic programming approach for subset sum is out of the question here because n is up to 60,000, which would make the DP approach O(n * S) which would be way too slow. For example, S can be as big as 60,000 * 60,001 / 2 ≈ 1.8e9. So even O(n^2) is not feasible here.\\n\\nTherefore, we need a greedy approach. Let's think if there's a pattern or a way to construct the subset.\\n\\nLet's consider that the numbers are 1 to n. Maybe we can start by trying to take the largest numbers first and see if adding them brings us closer to the target sum (S/2). Alternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical way to find the required subset.\\n\\nAnother approach: Let's think about whether it's possible to partition the numbers into two subsets with equal sum when S is even.\\n\\nIf S is even, then the target sum is T = S/2. We need to select some numbers that add up to T. Let's see if such a selection exists.\\n\\nAn observation here: For n >= 2, when the total sum is even, there's always a way to split the numbers into two subsets with sum T. How?\\n\\nWait, for example, when n is even, perhaps arranging the numbers in pairs. Like 1 and n, 2 and n-1, etc. Each pair sums to n+1. Then, if there are k pairs, each of sum n+1, then total sum is k*(n+1). But the total sum is also n(n+1)/2. So for even n, the sum is n/2 * (n+1). So when n is even, the sum is even only if (n+1) is even, i.e., when n is odd. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\\n\\nWait, the sum S = n(n+1)/2. For S to be even, n(n+1) must be divisible by 4. Because n and n+1 are consecutive, one of them is even. So either n is even, then n is divisible by 2, and n+1 is odd. So for S to be even, the product n*(n+1) must be divisible by 4, which happens if either n is divisible by 4 or n+1 is divisible by 4.\\n\\nSo when n mod 4 is 0 or 3, then S is even. For example, n=4: 4*5=20 → 20/2=10 even. n=3: 3*4=12 → 12/2=6 even. So S is even when n ≡ 0 mod 4 or n ≡ 3 mod 4.\\n\\nIn those cases, the target sum T is S/2. How to find a subset that sums to T?\\n\\nLet me think of the approach used in the sample. For n=4:\\n\\nWe need to select numbers that add up to 5. The solution was 1 and 4. Alternatively, 2 and 3. So perhaps the approach is to pair numbers from the ends.\\n\\nAnother example: n=3. S=6. T=3. The subset could be 3, or 1+2. So for n=3, possible.\\n\\nLet me think of n=5. S=15. Since S is odd, the difference is 1, so the minimum possible is 1. So the answer in that case would be 1. But for even S, when n is 5, that's not the case. Wait, n=5: sum is 15, which is odd. So difference must be 1.\\n\\nBut when n is 7, sum is 28, which is even. So target is 14. How to split?\\n\\nPossible subsets: 7 + 6 + 1 = 14? Let's see 7+6=13, plus 1 makes 14. Then the remaining numbers are 2,3,4,5. Sum is 2+3+4+5=14. So that works. So subset is 1,6,7.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here.\\n\\nAnother approach is to greedily add numbers starting from the largest possible and see if adding them helps reach the target.\\n\\nLet's think of the algorithm:\\n\\n1. Compute S = n(n+1)/2.\\n\\n2. If S is odd, the minimum difference is 1, and we can split the numbers such that one group has sum (S-1)/2 and the other (S+1)/2.\\n\\n   But how to construct the subset for this case?\\n\\nWait, perhaps when S is even, we need to split into two equal parts. When it's odd, the difference is 1.\\n\\nBut regardless of that, the problem is to find a subset whose sum is as close as possible to S/2.\\n\\nBut for the code, perhaps the first step is to determine whether the sum is even or odd. Then compute the target sum (floor(S/2) or ceiling(S/2) depending on parity). Then find a subset whose sum is that target.\\n\\nBut how to find such a subset efficiently.\\n\\nAlternative idea for even S:\\n\\nIf n is even:\\n\\nWait, perhaps when n is divisible by 4, the numbers can be partitioned into two groups with equal sum. For example, n=4: sum is 10, each group 5. For n=3: sum is 6, each group 3. So perhaps when n mod 4 is 0 or 3, the sum is even.\\n\\nWait, 3 mod 4 is 3, 4 mod 4 is 0.\\n\\nSo when n is congruent to 0 or 3 mod 4, sum is even, and possible to split. Otherwise, sum is odd, and difference is 1.\\n\\nSo the first step is to check the parity of the sum. Then, based on that, the minimal difference is either 0 or 1.\\n\\nBut the main problem is to find the subset of numbers that adds up to T, which is S//2 when S is even, or (S-1)/2 when S is odd.\\n\\nBut how?\\n\\nLet's think of the case when S is even. For example, n=7: sum is 28, T=14.\\n\\nWe need to find a subset of numbers 1-7 that sum to 14.\\n\\nOne possible approach is to start adding the largest possible numbers until we reach T.\\n\\nTake 7. Now current sum is 7. Remaining needed is 7. Next largest is 6: 7+6=13. Remaining needed 1. Take 1. Total sum 14.\\n\\nSo subset is {1,6,7}.\\n\\nAnother approach is to think of it as a greedy selection. Let's collect numbers from the end, and see if adding them brings us closer to the target.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern when n is 0 mod 4 or 3 mod 4.\\n\\nLet me think about when n mod 4 is 0.\\n\\nTake n=4: sum 10. T=5. The subset is 1 and 4. So sum 5.\\n\\nn=8: sum is 36. T=18.\\n\\nHow to split? Let's see. 8+7+3 = 18? 8+7=15, +3=18. The remaining numbers are 1,2,4,5,6. Sum is 1+2+4+5+6=18. Hmm, that's possible.\\n\\nAnother approach for n mod 4 ==0: group the numbers into pairs (1,4), (2,3), (5,8), (6,7), etc. Each pair sums to 5 (for the first pair). Wait, perhaps this is a general approach.\\n\\nWait, for n=4, the pairs (1,4) and (2,3) sum to 5 each. So take one pair from each group. For example, take 1 and 4 from the first pair and 3 from the second pair. Wait, no. Wait, for n=4, the sum is 10. So each group needs to sum to 5. The pairs are (1,4) and (2,3), each sum to 5. So taking one pair as a group would work. So group1 is {1,4}, group2 {2,3}.\\n\\nSimilarly, for n=8: the pairs would be (1,8), (2,7), (3,6), (4,5). Each pair sums to 9. There are 4 pairs. The total sum is 4*9=36. So group1 would take two pairs, sum 18. For example, take (1,8) and (4,5) → 9 +9 =18. So group1 is {1,8,4,5}.\\n\\nSo the approach here is to split the numbers into pairs (i, n+1 -i). Each pair sums to n+1. Then, for even n (n mod 4 ==0), the total pairs are n/2, each sum to n+1. So group1 takes half of the pairs, which is (n/2)/2 pairs. Wait, for n=4, pairs are 2. Take 1 pair. For n=8, pairs are 4. Take 2 pairs.\\n\\nSo group1 would consist of the first k pairs, where k is (n/2)/2. Wait, maybe this is a way to split.\\n\\nSimilarly, when n mod 4 ==3. For example, n=3. sum is 6, T=3. The possible subset is 3 or 1+2. So for n=3 mod4, perhaps the approach is to split into pairs but leave some numbers.\\n\\nWait, let's think for n=7. sum is 28 → T=14. How to split?\\n\\nThe pairs would be (1,7), (2,6), (3,5). That's 3 pairs. The sum of each pair is 8. The remaining number is 4.\\n\\nSo 3 pairs sum to 8*3=24, plus 4 → total sum 28. So to reach T=14, perhaps group1 takes (1,7) and (2,6) sum 8+8=16, which is over. Hmm, not sure.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe when n mod4 ==3, we can take 1, 2, then the pairs as needed.\\n\\nAnother approach for n mod4 ==3:\\n\\nFor example, n=3: group1 is 3. sum 3.\\n\\nn=7: group1 can be 1,2,3,4,4? Wait, no. Let's see. Sum 1+2+3+4=10. Not 14. Wait, perhaps for n=7, group1 is 7,6,1. Sum 7+6=13 +1=14.\\n\\nSo the approach here is to take the largest possible numbers first, then adjust with smaller ones.\\n\\nSo perhaps the general approach is:\\n\\nIf S is even (i.e., n mod4 is 0 or 3):\\n\\nWe need to select numbers such that their sum is T = S/2.\\n\\nThe algorithm can be:\\n\\n- Start from the largest number and greedily pick as long as adding it doesn't exceed T.\\n\\nBut this might not always work. Let's test for n=7.\\n\\nT=14. Current sum is 0.\\n\\nTake 7 → sum 7. Remaining 7.\\n\\nNext take 6 → sum 13. Remaining 1.\\n\\nTake 1 → sum 14. So group1 is {1,6,7}.\\n\\nAnother example, n=4: sum 10 → T=5.\\n\\nTake 4 → sum 4. Remaining 1.\\n\\nTake 1 → sum 5. So group1 is {1,4}.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nn=3: sum 6 → T=3. Take 3. sum 3.\\n\\nn=5: sum 15 → S is odd. So T=7. Need a subset sum of 7. Let's see:\\n\\nTake 5 → sum 5. Remaining 2.\\n\\nTake 2 → sum 7. So group1 is {2,5}. Sum 7. The other group is 1,3,4 → sum 8. Difference is 1.\\n\\nSo for S odd, the difference is 1, which is correct.\\n\\nSo the algorithm could be:\\n\\nCompute S = n(n+1)/2.\\n\\nIf S is even:\\n\\n   T = S//2\\n\\n   Find a subset of numbers from 1 to n that sums to T.\\n\\nElse:\\n\\n   T = (S-1) // 2\\n\\n   Find a subset that sums to T.\\n\\nBut how to find such a subset efficiently.\\n\\nThe approach for even S (n mod4 0 or 3):\\n\\nStart from the largest number and subtract from T, adding to the subset until T is zero.\\n\\nBut this might not always work. Let's see for n=7:\\n\\nT=14.\\n\\nTake 7 → T=7 left. Then take 6 → T=1 left. Then take 1. Sum is 14.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nFor n=8, T=18.\\n\\nStart with 8 → T=10.\\n\\n7 → T=3. Then take 3 → T=0. So subset is 8,7,3. Sum 18.\\n\\nYes. The other group would sum to 18 as well.\\n\\nSo this approach seems to work.\\n\\nSo the algorithm steps would be:\\n\\nInitialize current_sum =0, subset = empty list.\\n\\nStart from i =n down to 1:\\n\\n   if current_sum + i <= T:\\n\\n       add i to subset, current_sum +=i.\\n\\nOnce all numbers are processed, if current_sum == T, done.\\n\\nThis is a greedy approach, and for numbers 1..n, this seems to work.\\n\\nBut why does this work?\\n\\nBecause the numbers are consecutive, and starting from the largest allows us to reach the target sum in the minimal steps.\\n\\nBut let's test for n=5 (S=15, T=7).\\n\\nGreedy approach:\\n\\nTake 5 → sum 5. T left 2.\\n\\nThen 4 → sum 9 (exceeds T). Skip.\\n\\n3: sum 5+3=8 → exceeds. Skip.\\n\\n2: sum 5+2=7 → yes. So subset is 5,2. Sum is 7.\\n\\nSo that works.\\n\\nAnother example, n=6. sum is 21 (S is odd). T=10.\\n\\nWait, no: S=21. T would be 10 (since (21-1)/2=10). So the difference is 1.\\n\\nSo the code needs to find a subset summing to 10.\\n\\nGreedy approach:\\n\\nTake 6 → sum 6. T left 4.\\n\\nTake 5 → sum 11 (exceeds). Skip.\\n\\nTake 4 → 6+4=10. So subset is [6,4]. Sum 10.\\n\\nSo that works.\\n\\nSo the greedy approach seems to work for even and odd S cases.\\n\\nSo the algorithm is:\\n\\nCompute S = n(n+1)/2.\\n\\nIf S is even, target is S//2.\\n\\nElse, target is (S-1)//2.\\n\\nInitialize a list to hold the subset.\\n\\ncurrent_sum =0.\\n\\nIterate from n down to 1:\\n\\n   if current_sum + i <= target:\\n\\n       add i to subset.\\n\\n       current_sum +=i.\\n\\nOnce done, the subset's sum is the target.\\n\\nThis approach will work for all cases.\\n\\nBut why?\\n\\nBecause the numbers are consecutive, and the greedy selection will cover the required sum.\\n\\nIn the case where sum is even, after selecting the largest possible, then the next largest, etc., the remaining sum can be covered by the smaller numbers.\\n\\nSo the code can be written as follows.\\n\\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\\n\\nFirst, compute S.\\n\\nThen compute the target.\\n\\nThen iterate from n down to 1, adding to the subset if possible.\\n\\nOnce the subset is formed, the other group is the remaining numbers.\\n\\nNow, for the output:\\n\\nWe need to print the size of the subset, followed by the elements.\\n\\nBut for large n (up to 60,000), building a list for the subset is feasible as long as we don't do any O(n^2) operations.\\n\\nBut in Python, building a list by appending in a loop is O(n) time, which is acceptable.\\n\\nSo steps for code:\\n\\nRead n.\\n\\nCompute S = n*(n+1)//2.\\n\\nCompute target:\\n\\nif S %2 ==0:\\n\\n    target = S//2\\n\\nelse:\\n\\n    target = (S-1)//2\\n\\ndiff = S - 2*target → which is 0 if even, 1 otherwise.\\n\\nThen, collect the subset.\\n\\nInitialize subset as a list.\\n\\ncurrent_sum =0\\n\\nfor i from n downto 1:\\n\\n    if current_sum +i <= target:\\n\\n        current_sum +=i\\n\\n        subset.append(i)\\n\\nOnce collected, check if current_sum == target.\\n\\nBut since the numbers are consecutive and the algorithm is correct, this should always be true.\\n\\nOnce the subset is formed, output the difference (diff), then the size of the subset followed by the elements.\\n\\nBut wait, in the case of S even, the difference is 0. Else, 1.\\n\\nNow, the code should work for all cases.\\n\\nLet me test with the sample inputs.\\n\\nSample 1: n=4.\\n\\nS=10 even. target=5.\\n\\nIterate from 4 down:\\n\\n4 → sum 4 <=5 → add. sum=4.\\n\\n3 → sum+3=7>5 → skip.\\n\\n2 → sum+2=6>5 → skip.\\n\\n1 → sum+1=5 → add. sum=5.\\n\\nsubset is [4,1]. size 2. So output:\\n\\n0\\n\\n2 4 1 → which matches the sample.\\n\\nSample 2: n=2.\\n\\nsum=3, which is odd. target=(3-1)/2=1.\\n\\nIterate from 2 down.\\n\\n2 is larger than 1 → can't add.\\n\\n1: sum+1=1 <=1 → add. sum=1.\\n\\nsubset is [1]. size 1. So output is:\\n\\n1\\n\\n1 1 → which matches the sample.\\n\\nAnother test case: n=5. sum 15 → target 7.\\n\\nsubset:\\n\\n5 → sum 5. next 4: 5+4=9>7 → skip. 3: 5+3=8>7 → skip. 2: 5+2=7 → add. sum=7. subset [5,2]. size 2. Output difference 1.\\n\\nAnother example: n=7. sum 28 even. target 14.\\n\\nsubset:7 →7. 6 →13. 5 →13+5=18>14 → skip. 4 →13+4=17>14 → skip. 3 →13+3=16>14 → skip. 2 →13+2=15>14 → skip. 1 →13+1=14 → add. subset [7,6,1]. size 3. sum 14. output difference 0.\\n\\nYes, correct.\\n\\nNow, the code needs to handle n up to 60,000. Building the subset list is O(n) time and O(k) space where k is the size of the subset, which is up to 30,000 elements. That's acceptable.\\n\\nIn Python, appending to a list is O(1) amortized. So the code will be efficient.\\n\\nSo the code steps:\\n\\nRead n.\\n\\nCompute sum and target.\\n\\nCollect the subset.\\n\\nPrint the difference.\\n\\nPrint the subset's size and elements.\\n\\nNow, code:\\n\\nBut how to iterate from n down to 1:\\n\\nIn Python, for i in range(n, 0, -1):\\n\\nSo:\\n\\nsubset = []\\n\\ncurrent_sum =0\\n\\nfor i in range(n, 0, -1):\\n\\n    if current_sum +i <= target:\\n\\n        subset.append(i)\\n\\n        current_sum +=i\\n\\nThen output.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nSo the code should be straightforward.\\n\\nLet's code this.\\n\\nTesting for n=3:\\n\\nsum 6, even. target 3.\\n\\nsubset: 3 → sum 3. So output 0, size 1, element 3. Or wait, the other group is 1,2. But according to the problem statement, both groups must be non-empty. So for n=3, subset is [3]. The other group is 1,2. Both are non-empty. Correct.\\n\\nAnother example, n=1 is not possible as per the constraints (n >=2).\\n\\nSo code seems correct.\\n\\nNow, the code must read n from input, compute, and output.\\n\\nThe code:\\n\\nRead n.\\n\\nCompute S = n*(n+1) // 2.\\n\\nif S %2 ==0:\\n\\n    diff =0\\n\\n    target = S//2\\n\\nelse:\\n\\n    diff =1\\n\\n    target = (S-1)//2\\n\\nsubset = []\\n\\ncurrent =0\\n\\nfor i in range(n, 0, -1):\\n\\n    if current +i <= target:\\n\\n        subset.append(i)\\n\\n        current +=i\\n\\nprint(diff)\\n\\nprint(len(subset), end=' ')\\n\\nprint(' '.join(map(str, subset)))\\n\\nBut wait, in the case where the subset is empty, but according to the problem statement, both groups must be non-empty. But according to the code, the subset will have at least one element, since the target is at least 1 (since when n>=2, the sum S >=3, and when S is even, target is S/2 >= (2*(2+1)/2)/2 = 3/2 → floor 1.5 → but for n=2, sum is 3. So S is odd. target is (3-1)/2=1. The subset is [1]. So correct.\\n\\nBut for the code, when target is 0, but n>=2, which is impossible. So no cases where subset is empty.\\n\\nSo the code is safe.\\n\\nTesting n=2:\\n\\nsubset is [1]. Size 1. Output: 1 1.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nThus, this should solve the problem.\\n</think>\\n\\n```python\\nn = int(input())\\ntotal = n * (n + 1) // 2\\nif total % 2 == 0:\\n    target = total // 2\\n    diff = 0\\nelse:\\n    target = (total - 1) // 2\\n    diff = 1\\n\\nsubset = []\\ncurrent_sum = 0\\nfor i in range(n, 0, -1):\\n    if current_sum + i <= target:\\n        subset.append(i)\\n        current_sum += i\\n\\nprint(diff)\\nprint(len(subset), end=' ')\\nprint(' '.join(map(str, subset)))\\n```\", '<think>\\nOkay, so I need to solve this problem where I have to find a maximal independent set in an undirected graph. The independent set is a set of vertices where none of them are adjacent. And the goal is to get as large a set as possible. Since the problem says it\\'s okay not to be optimal but to get as many points as possible, I need an efficient heuristic approach that works well for large graphs.\\n\\nFirst, let\\'s think about the constraints. The input graphs can be very big. For example, in the B4 subtask, the graph might have up to 10^5 nodes or even more. So, the solution needs to handle that efficiently in terms of time and memory.\\n\\nThe classic approach for finding a maximal independent set (not maximum) is a greedy algorithm. But which greedy strategy? There are a few possibilities. One common method is to process the vertices in some order (like descending order of degree) and select a vertex if none of its neighbors have been selected yet. Alternatively, there\\'s the approach of repeatedly picking the vertex with the smallest degree, adding it to the set, and removing its neighbors. But maybe there\\'s a better heuristic here.\\n\\nWait, another idea: for each vertex, if it\\'s not adjacent to any selected vertices, add it to the set. But the order in which we process the vertices matters. Processing high-degree vertices first might not be optimal. Because adding a high-degree vertex would exclude many others. Alternatively, maybe processing low-degree vertices first allows more vertices to be added. Hmm.\\n\\nI remember reading that for the maximum independent set problem, which is NP-hard, greedy algorithms can give good approximations. For example, one approach is to select the vertex with the smallest degree, add it to the independent set, and then remove it and all its neighbors. Repeat until the graph is empty. This is called the greedy minimal degree algorithm. This might be a good approach here.\\n\\nLet me think: when you select a vertex of minimal degree, you eliminate that vertex and its neighbors. Since the vertex has minimal degree, it\\'s connected to the fewest possible other vertices. So removing those neighbors (who may have higher degrees) might leave more options for other vertices to be included. This could lead to a larger independent set.\\n\\nSo the plan is:\\n\\n1. Represent the graph efficiently. For each vertex, have a list of its neighbors. But since the graph can be large, we need a way to manage the adjacency lists and track which vertices are still active.\\n\\n2. Use a priority queue (or some structure) to keep track of the current minimal degree vertices. But maintaining the degrees dynamically as vertices are removed could be computationally intensive. Because when a vertex is removed (added to the independent set), all its neighbors are also removed. Each such removal affects the degrees of their neighbors.\\n\\nWait, but perhaps a more efficient approach is needed. Let\\'s outline the steps:\\n\\n- Initialize all vertices as active.\\n- While there are active vertices:\\n   - Find the active vertex with the smallest degree.\\n   - Add it to the independent set.\\n   - Mark it and all its neighbors as inactive.\\n\\nBut how to efficiently track the degrees of active vertices as neighbors are removed?\\n\\nStoring the adjacency lists and a list of active vertices, along with current degrees. But when a vertex is removed (as part of adding to the set or being a neighbor), we need to update the degrees of their neighbors. However, this can be expensive if done naively for large graphs.\\n\\nAlternatively, since once a vertex is removed (either added to the set or as a neighbor), it\\'s no longer considered. So perhaps we can process the vertices in order of their initial degrees, but that\\'s static and might not account for the dynamic changes as vertices are removed. Alternatively, we can recompute the degrees of remaining vertices each time, but that would be O(n) each iteration, leading to O(n^2) time, which is not feasible for large n.\\n\\nHmm. So for very large graphs, this approach might not be feasible. Let\\'s think about the time constraints. For example, a graph with 1e5 vertices and 1e6 edges. The algorithm must run in O(m + n) or O(n log n) time.\\n\\nAnother approach: use a heuristic that processes the vertices in some order and greedily selects each vertex if none of its neighbors have been selected yet. For example, process the vertices in order of increasing degree. But how to implement this efficiently.\\n\\nAlternatively, a simple linear pass through the vertices in a certain order, adding the vertex to the set only if none of its already processed neighbors are in the set. This is a standard greedy approach and runs in O(n + m) time. But the order of processing can significantly affect the result. For example, processing in order of increasing degree (lowest first) might yield a larger set, as choosing a vertex with low degree early on doesn\\'t block too many others.\\n\\nSo the algorithm steps would be:\\n\\n- Sort all vertices in increasing order of degree.\\n- Iterate through the sorted list, and for each vertex, add it to the set if none of its neighbors (who have already been processed) are in the set.\\n\\nWait, but in this approach, since we process vertices in a certain order, when considering a vertex, we check if any of its neighbors that have already been processed (and thus are in the set) would conflict. If none are in the set, we add the current vertex. Since we process in order, once a vertex is added, its neighbors (processed later) won\\'t be added.\\n\\nBut this depends on the order. For example, if you process in reverse order (high degree first), adding a high-degree vertex would prevent all its neighbors from being added. But in the case of low-degree first, adding a low-degree vertex blocks fewer neighbors. So this might lead to a larger set.\\n\\nSo implementing this approach would involve:\\n\\n1. Preprocessing the degrees of each vertex.\\n2. Sorting the vertices in order of increasing degree.\\n3. Iterating through this sorted list, and for each vertex, check if any of its neighbors that have already been considered (processed earlier) are in the set. If not, add it to the set.\\n\\nBut how to efficiently check if any neighbor in the set? Because for each vertex, you have to check all its neighbors, but since you process the vertices in order, the neighbors that are processed after the current vertex are not in the set yet. So when checking, you only need to look at neighbors that have been processed before the current vertex. Wait, no. Because the neighbors could be processed either before or after. For example, if vertex A is processed before vertex B, and A and B are connected. If A is not added to the set, then B can be added. But if A is added, B cannot. So during the processing of B, you check whether any of its neighbors that are already processed (i.e., those with index less than B in the sorted list) have been added to the set.\\n\\nWait, but how to track that. Let\\'s think: the vertices are sorted in some order, say S. For each vertex v in S, we process them one by one. For each v, when considering adding to the set, we check if any of its neighbors that are already in the set. The set is built incrementally. So during processing v, the only neighbors that could be in the set are those that come before v in S and have been processed and added. Because neighbors that come after v in S haven\\'t been processed yet, so they can\\'t be in the set.\\n\\nSo, for each vertex v in the sorted list, when processing it, check all its neighbors. If any neighbor u has been added to the set (i.e., u is in the set and was processed before v), then v cannot be added. Otherwise, add v to the set.\\n\\nBut this requires, for each v, to check all its neighbors. For large graphs, this could be O(m) time. Which is acceptable if m is up to 1e6 or even 1e7. For example, 1e6 edges would take 1e6 operations, which is manageable in Python within 1 second.\\n\\nSo the steps are:\\n\\n- Read the graph, compute degrees for each vertex.\\n- Sort the vertices in increasing order of degree (so low-degree first).\\n- For each vertex in this order:\\n   - Check if any of its neighbors have already been added to the independent set.\\n   - If none are present, add this vertex to the set.\\n\\nThis approach is O(m) time (for checking neighbors) plus O(n log n) for sorting. Which should be acceptable for n up to 1e5.\\n\\nBut wait, when a vertex is processed, we check all its neighbors. For example, a vertex with degree 1000 would require checking 1000 neighbors. For a graph with m edges, this is O(m) in total. So overall, the algorithm is O(n log n + m) time, which is manageable.\\n\\nThis seems like a feasible approach. Let\\'s think about how to implement this.\\n\\nIn Python, we can represent the adjacency list as a list of sets. For each vertex v, adj[v] is a set of its neighbors.\\n\\nWe first compute the degrees. Then, sort the vertices in increasing order of their degree. Then, iterate through each vertex in this order. For each, check if any of its neighbors are already in the set. To track which vertices are in the set, we can use a boolean array (selected) where selected[v] is True if v is in the set.\\n\\nSo the steps are:\\n\\nInitialize selected as all False.\\n\\nsorted_vertices = sorted(range(1, n+1), key=lambda x: len(adj[x]))\\n\\nfor v in sorted_vertices:\\n    if any(selected[u] for u in adj[v]):\\n        continue\\n    else:\\n        selected[v] = True\\n\\nFinally, output all v where selected[v] is True.\\n\\nThis approach should work and is efficient. However, there\\'s a problem here. When processing in sorted order, the check for neighbors includes all neighbors, even those that come later in the sorted list. But those neighbors haven\\'t been processed yet. Wait, no. Because the sorted list is the order in which we process the vertices. So when processing v, any neighbor u that is processed after v (i.e., comes later in the sorted_vertices list) hasn\\'t been considered yet. So when checking selected[u], those u\\'s are still False because they haven\\'t been processed. So the check is only for neighbors that have already been processed (i.e., are in the sorted list before v).\\n\\nWait, no. The sorted_vertices list is in the order of processing. So for a given v in the list, all the vertices that come before v have been processed, and their selected status is known. The vertices after v in the list have not been processed yet, so their selected status is False. So when checking the neighbors of v, the only ones that could possibly be selected are those that are before v in the sorted list. The ones after are not, but since we haven\\'t processed them yet, their selected status is False. Therefore, when processing v, the check for any neighbor in the selected set is equivalent to checking the neighbors that are processed before v.\\n\\nBut this approach may miss some opportunities. For example, if v is processed after u (a neighbor), but u is not selected, then during processing v, even if u is not selected, but u comes before v in the list, then v can be selected. But when u is processed later, but u\\'s neighbors are checked, but in that case, when u is processed, since v was processed earlier (if u comes after v in the list), but that\\'s not possible. So the order matters. Because sorted_vertices is in a fixed order, and processing is done in that order.\\n\\nWait, no. The sorted_vertices list is sorted in the order of increasing degree. So, if u has a lower degree than v, u comes before v. So when processing u first, if u is not selected (because one of its neighbors that comes before u in the list was selected), then when processing v, it can be selected if none of its processed neighbors (those before it in the list) are selected.\\n\\nBut perhaps there\\'s a smarter way. For example, when processing vertices in order of increasing degree, selecting a vertex early (if possible) blocks fewer neighbors. So this could lead to a larger set.\\n\\nAnother variation: process the vertices in a certain order (like random, or some other heuristic), but for each vertex, if none of the already selected vertices are adjacent to it, select it. This is a greedy approach that builds a maximal independent set.\\n\\nThe approach I described earlier (processing in order of increasing degree and selecting a vertex if none of its already selected neighbors have been selected) should result in a maximal independent set. Because once processing is done, you can\\'t add any more vertices to the set without conflicting with existing ones.\\n\\nSo the algorithm is correct in that it produces an independent set. The question is, how to maximize the size of this set.\\n\\nNow, the next step is to implement this in Python, in a way that\\'s efficient for large graphs.\\n\\nBut handling the adjacency list for large n (like 1e5) can be memory-intensive. In Python, for n=1e5, using a list of sets for adjacency is feasible. Because each edge is stored twice (once for each direction), but for m edges, the total storage is 2m.\\n\\nBut for n=1e5 and m=1e6, that\\'s 2e6 entries, which is manageable.\\n\\nNow, reading the input quickly is important. For Python, using sys.stdin.readline is better than input() for speed.\\n\\nSo, steps for code:\\n\\n1. Read n and m from input.\\n2. Read m lines of edges. For each edge (a, b), add b to adj[a] and a to adj[b]. Since vertices are 1-based.\\n3. Compute the degrees for each vertex as the length of their adjacency list.\\n4. Sort the vertices in increasing order of degree. So sorted_vertices = sorted(range(1, n+1), key=lambda x: len(adj[x])).\\n5. Initialize a list selected of size n+1 (indexes 0 to n) with False.\\n6. Iterate over each vertex in sorted_vertices. For each v:\\n   a. Check if any neighbor u in adj[v] has selected[u] is True.\\n   b. If no such neighbor, set selected[v] to True.\\n7. After processing all, collect all v where selected[v] is True. Output the count and the binary list.\\n\\nBut step 6a could be time-consuming for vertices with high degrees. For example, a vertex with 1e5 neighbors would require checking all 1e5 entries. But in practice, if the graph is sparse (like B1-B4, which I don\\'t know the exact structure of), this could be manageable.\\n\\nBut for large m (like 1e6 edges), checking all neighbors for each vertex in sorted order would take O(m) time overall, which is acceptable.\\n\\nBut how to optimize this in Python? Because checking any(selected[u] for u in adj[v]) is O(k) for k being the degree of v.\\n\\nAlternative idea: for each vertex v, when processing, check only the neighbors that have been processed (i.e., are in the sorted list before v). Because any neighbor that comes after v in the sorted list hasn\\'t been processed yet, and their selected status is False. So, in the adjacency list of v, when checking for selected[u], those u that are after v in the sorted list can be skipped. But how to efficiently check this.\\n\\nWait, the sorted list is in a particular order. So for v in the sorted list, all u in adj[v] that are in the sorted list before v can have selected[u] True or False, but those after v in the sorted list are not yet processed, so their selected[u] is False.\\n\\nTherefore, when processing v, we can check all u in adj[v], but only those u that are in the sorted list before v could have selected[u] True. So, in practice, for each u in adj[v], if u is processed before v (i.e., appears before in the sorted_vertices list), then selected[u] might be True. If u is processed after v, then selected[u] is False.\\n\\nTherefore, during the processing of v, checking all u in adj[v] for selected[u] is equivalent to checking all u that are processed before v. Because those processed after v are not in the selected set yet.\\n\\nSo the check is correct.\\n\\nBut in Python, for each u in adj[v], we have to check selected[u], which could be O(1) for each, but for a large degree, it\\'s O(k) per vertex. So, for a graph with m edges, this is O(m) time overall.\\n\\nIn practice, this is manageable.\\n\\nNow, code implementation:\\n\\nRead n and m.\\n\\nThen, read m edges, build adjacency lists.\\n\\nThen, sort the vertices in increasing order of degree.\\n\\nThen, process each vertex in that order.\\n\\nNow, in Python, for speed, using adjacency lists as sets is better for lookups, but in our case, the adjacency lists are for iterating over all neighbors. So a list might be faster than a set, but for building the adjacency, we need to avoid duplicates. However, the problem states that the input doesn\\'t have multiple edges, so each edge is unique. So when building adj, for each a and b, append to each other\\'s list.\\n\\nBut in Python, lists are okay. However, when checking the neighbors, it\\'s a list, and for each u in adj[v], we check selected[u].\\n\\nBut with m edges, each edge is stored twice (once in a\\'s list, once in b\\'s), but in the code, for each edge a-b, we add b to adj[a] and a to adj[b]. So the adjacency lists have 2m entries.\\n\\nBut when processing each vertex, each edge is checked once (once for each direction). So the total time is O(m) for the checks.\\n\\nBut in practice, each edge is checked once for each direction. Wait, no. Because when processing vertex a, we check all its neighbors (including b). Then when processing vertex b, if it\\'s after a in the sorted list, then during processing a, if a is selected, then when processing b, the check for a (selected) would prevent b from being selected. But if a is not selected, then when processing b, the check would look at a\\'s selected status. But a is processed before b, so a\\'s selected status is already determined.\\n\\nSo the code\\'s logic is correct.\\n\\nBut the code will check each edge twice. For example, edge a-b: when processing a, it checks b\\'s selected status (but if b is processed after a, then during a\\'s processing, b is not selected yet. So the check is redundant. Similarly, when processing b, it checks a\\'s selected status (which is already known). But in this case, the code will check all edges in both directions. So the total number of checks is 2m.\\n\\nBut for m=1e6, that\\'s 2e6 checks, each of which is a O(1) lookup. That\\'s manageable in Python within 1 second.\\n\\nSo the code can proceed.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s think about possible optimizations.\\n\\nIn Python, for checking if any neighbor is selected, perhaps using a generator expression and the any() function is efficient. For example, any(selected[u] for u in adj[v]).\\n\\nBut for each vertex v, the adjacency list adj[v] is a list (or set) of its neighbors. Iterating through that list and checking selected[u] for each u is O(k), which is necessary.\\n\\nAnother possible optimization: precompute the order of processing, and for each vertex, only check the neighbors that have been processed before it. But how?\\n\\nBecause the sorted_vertices list is in a fixed order. So, for each vertex v in sorted_vertices, the index in the list is known. For a given u in adj[v], if u is in the sorted_vertices list at a position before v\\'s position, then u has been processed already. So during processing v, we can check only those u that are in the sorted_vertices list before v. But how to check that?\\n\\nBut how to find the position of u in the sorted_vertices list. To do that, we can create a dictionary that maps each vertex to its index in the sorted_vertices list. For example:\\n\\nsorted_vertices = sorted(...)\\npos = {v: idx for idx, v in enumerate(sorted_vertices)}\\n\\nThen, for each u in adj[v], during processing v, we can check if pos[u] < pos[v]. If so, then u has been processed before v, and selected[u] could be True. Otherwise, u is processed after v, so selected[u] is False and can be ignored.\\n\\nThis way, during the check, we can skip the u\\'s that are processed after v.\\n\\nThis could reduce the number of checks. For example, if a vertex v has neighbors that are processed after v, their selected status is False, so we don\\'t need to check them. So, for each v, we only check the neighbors that are in the sorted list before v.\\n\\nThis would reduce the total number of checks from 2m to m (since each edge is checked once: for the vertex with the earlier position in the sorted list).\\n\\nWait, let\\'s see. For edge a-b, if a is processed before b (pos[a] < pos[b]), then during processing a, when checking neighbors, b is not yet processed (so selected[b] is False). So during a\\'s processing, the check for b is skipped. Then, during processing b, since a is processed earlier (pos[a] < pos[b]), we check a\\'s selected status. So for each edge, the check is done once (for the vertex with the higher position in the list). So the total checks would be m instead of 2m.\\n\\nThis could significantly speed up the code for large m.\\n\\nSo the modified algorithm is:\\n\\n- For each vertex v in sorted_vertices order:\\n\\n   for u in adj[v]:\\n      if pos[u] < pos[v]:\\n          if selected[u] is True:\\n              mark v as not selected and break the loop.\\n\\nSo the code would check only the neighbors that are processed before v. This reduces the number of checks.\\n\\nThis seems like a valuable optimization. How to implement this.\\n\\nFirst, create a position dictionary:\\n\\nsorted_vertices = sorted(...)\\npos = {v: i for i, v in enumerate(sorted_vertices)}\\n\\nThen, for each v in sorted_vertices:\\n\\n    if any(selected[u] for u in adj[v] if pos[u] < pos[v]):\\n        continue\\n    else:\\n        selected[v] = True\\n\\nBut how efficient is this in Python? For each u in adj[v], we check if pos[u] < pos[v], which is O(1) with a dictionary. Then, if any of the selected[u] is True for those u\\'s.\\n\\nThis reduces the number of checks from O(2m) to O(m), which is a 2x improvement. This is especially important for large m.\\n\\nSo this is a necessary optimization.\\n\\nTherefore, the steps for code are:\\n\\n1. Read n and m.\\n\\n2. Read m edges and build adjacency lists as a list of sets or lists.\\n\\n3. Sort the vertices in increasing order of degree to get sorted_vertices.\\n\\n4. Create a pos dictionary that maps each vertex to its index in the sorted_vertices list.\\n\\n5. Initialize selected as [False] * (n+1).\\n\\n6. For each v in sorted_vertices:\\n\\n   a. Check if any u in adj[v] where pos[u] < pos[v] and selected[u] is True.\\n\\n   b. If none, set selected[v] = True.\\n\\nThis way, during the check for v, we only consider neighbors u that are processed before v. The ones processed after are not checked, as their selected[u] is False.\\n\\nThis reduces the number of checks.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s think about implementing this in Python.\\n\\nBut for large n (like 1e5), building the pos dictionary with a loop is O(n), which is acceptable.\\n\\nSo code:\\n\\nimport sys\\n\\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\\nadj = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\\nfor _ in range(m):\\n    a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\\n    adj[a].append(b)\\n    adj[b].append(a)\\n\\nsorted_vertices = sorted(range(1, n+1), key=lambda x: len(adj[x]))\\npos = {v: i for i, v in enumerate(sorted_vertices)}\\n\\nselected = [False] * (n+1)\\n\\nfor v in sorted_vertices:\\n    conflict = False\\n    for u in adj[v]:\\n        if pos[u] < pos[v] and selected[u]:\\n            conflict = True\\n            break\\n    if not conflict:\\n        selected[v] = True\\n\\ncount = sum(selected)\\nprint(count)\\nprint(\\' \\'.join(map(str, [int(selected[i]) for i in range(1, n+1)])))\\n\\nBut wait, in the code above, adj is a list of lists, not sets. So for each edge, it\\'s stored twice. For example, a and b each have each other in their adjacency lists.\\n\\nBut the code reads the edges correctly.\\n\\nNow, in the code, sorted_vertices is ordered by len(adj[x]), which is the initial degree of the vertex. But after vertices are removed (marked as selected or not), the degrees of the remaining vertices could change. However, this approach uses the initial degrees, not the dynamic ones. So this is a heuristic based on the original graph.\\n\\nBut this heuristic is the same as the greedy minimal degree algorithm, except that it\\'s based on initial degrees, not the current degrees. But in practice, this could still yield a good result.\\n\\nAnother point: the order is fixed once sorted_vertices is computed, regardless of any changes in the graph. So this is a static ordering.\\n\\nBut how does this compare to the dynamic approach where after selecting a vertex, the degrees of remaining vertices are updated? The dynamic approach is more accurate but computationally expensive.\\n\\nFor large graphs, the dynamic approach may not be feasible. So the static ordering is a trade-off between time and solution quality.\\n\\nIn the code above, we\\'re using the static ordering. But this could lead to a good approximation.\\n\\nAnother possible optimization: process the vertices in the order of increasing current degree. But as the degrees change when vertices are selected, this is not feasible unless we have a way to track degrees efficiently.\\n\\nBut that\\'s probably not possible in Python for large n and m within the time constraints.\\n\\nTherefore, the code as written is a feasible solution that can handle large graphs and provides a good approximation.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s test the code with a small example.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\nn=3, m=2\\n\\nEdges: 1-2, 2-3.\\n\\nThe degrees are:\\n\\n1: 1\\n\\n2: 2\\n\\n3: 1\\n\\nsorted_vertices would be [1,3,2], because their degrees are 1,1,2.\\n\\nProcessing order: 1,3,2.\\n\\nProcessing 1: check neighbors (2). Since 2 is in the sorted list after 1, pos[2] is 2 which is greater than pos[1] (0). So no neighbor processed before. So select 1. selected[1] = True.\\n\\nProcessing 3: check neighbors (2). 2\\'s pos is 2, which is greater than pos[3] (1). So no neighbor processed before. So select 3. selected[3] = True.\\n\\nProcessing 2: check neighbors (1 and 3). Both 1 and 3 are processed before (pos 0 and 1). selected[1] and selected[3] are True. So conflict exists. So 2 is not selected.\\n\\nThe independent set is {1,3}, size 2. Which is correct.\\n\\nAnother example:\\n\\nn=4, m=4\\n\\nEdges: 1-2, 1-3, 2-3, 3-4.\\n\\nDegrees:\\n\\n1: 2\\n\\n2: 2\\n\\n3: 3\\n\\n4: 1\\n\\nsorted_vertices order: 4 (degree 1), 1 (2), 2 (2), 3 (3).\\n\\nProcessing 4: check neighbors (3). 3 is in the sorted list after 4 (pos 3). So no conflict. selected[4] = True.\\n\\nProcessing 1: check neighbors (2 and 3). 2 and 3 are processed after 1 (positions 2 and 3). So no conflict. selected[1] = True.\\n\\nProcessing 2: check neighbors (1,3). 1 is processed before (pos 1). selected[1] is True. Conflict. So 2 is not selected.\\n\\nProcessing 3: check neighbors (1,2,4). 1 and 2 are processed before. selected[1] is True. So conflict. Not selected.\\n\\nSo the independent set is {4,1}, size 2. But in this graph, there\\'s a larger independent set: {1,4} is size 2. But perhaps there\\'s a better one. Wait, in this graph, another possible set is {2,4} which is also size 2. Or {3} which is size 1. Wait, no. The maximum independent set here is 2. So the code\\'s output is correct.\\n\\nBut in another scenario, perhaps a different order would yield a larger set.

We need to find two integers x and y such that l ≤ x < y ≤ r, and their LCM is between l and r inclusive. If not possible, output -1 -1.\\n\\nFirst, the problem examples give some clues. For instance, in the third test case (2 4), the answer is 2 and 4. Their LCM is 4, which is within the range. So in that case, choosing consecutive even numbers might be a good idea.\\n\\nHmm. Let's think about when it's possible. The key is to find x and y where LCM(x,y) is ≤ r. Because if x and y are both ≤ r, then their LCM must be ≤ r * (y-1) or something, but that's not helpful. Wait, wait. The LCM of x and y is the smallest number divisible by both. So LCM(x,y) is at least max(x,y), since the maximum of x and y is already a multiple of itself. But since y > x (since x < y), then LCM(x,y) ≥ y. But since y ≤ r, the LCM must be ≥ y. So the LCM needs to be between l and r. But wait, the LCM is at least y, which is at least x+1 (since x < y). So for the LCM to be ≤ r, we need y ≤ r. But y is already ≤ r. So the real constraint is that LCM(x,y) ≤ r.\\n\\nSo how can we find x and y such that their LCM is ≤ r? The minimal possible LCM is when x and y are such that one divides the other. For example, if y is a multiple of x. Then LCM(x,y) = y. So in this case, if y is ≤ r, then the LCM is exactly y. So if we can find such a pair where y is between l and r, then the LCM is y, which is within the required range.\\n\\nSo the strategy could be: look for two consecutive even numbers, or a number and its double, but perhaps the simplest approach is to check if there exists a pair where one is a multiple of the other. For example, x and y where y is 2x. But perhaps even simpler: check if there is a pair x and 2x where 2x is ≤ r. If that's possible, then LCM(x, 2x) is 2x, which is ≤ r. So if l ≤ x < 2x ≤ r, then x and 2x would be a valid pair.\\n\\nWait, but how to find x such that 2x is ≤ r and x ≥ l. So x can be as low as l, but 2x has to be ≤ r. So the maximum x in this case is r//2. So if l <= r//2, then x can be l, and y = 2*l. Then LCM is 2*l. And we need to check if this LCM is >= l (which it is) and <= r. So as long as 2*l <= r, then x = l and y = 2*l would work. Because LCM(l, 2l) = 2l. So for example, if the input is 2 4, then 2*2=4 <=4, so LCM is 4 which is within 2 and 4.\\n\\nSo in this case, if 2*l <= r, then the answer is l and 2*l. Because x < y (since l < 2l when l is at least 1), and LCM is 2l which is <=r.\\n\\nBut wait, in the third test case of the example (2 4), 2*2=4, which is equal to r. So that's acceptable. So if 2*l <= r, then output l and 2*l.\\n\\nBut what if l is such that 2*l > r? Then that approach wouldn't work. For example, in the case where l is 3 and r is 5. Then 2*3=6>5, so we can't do that. So in that case, we need another approach.\\n\\nAlternatively, if there's any even number between l and r. For example, if there are two consecutive numbers where one is even. Let's think: take x and x+1. Their LCM is x*(x+1) if they are coprime, but that's probably larger than r. So that's not useful unless x and x+1 are small. But for larger l and r, x and x+1 would be large, making their LCM possibly exceed r.\\n\\nHmm. So perhaps the best approach is to check if there's a pair where one is a multiple of the other. If that exists, then return that pair. Otherwise, check other possibilities.\\n\\nBut how to check this efficiently.\\n\\nAnother approach: if there exists any x in [l, r] such that 2x <= r. Then x and 2x is a valid pair. So the minimal x is l, and 2x must be <=r. So if l*2 <=r, then the answer is l and 2l.\\n\\nSo in the first example input:\\n\\nTest case 1: l=1, r=1337. Then 1*2=2 <=1337. So the answer is 1 and 2. But the sample output is 6 and 7. Wait, that's conflicting. Oh, wait. Wait, no. The sample output for the first test case is 6 7. Hmm. But according to this logic, why isn't 1 and 2 the answer? Because their LCM is 2, which is between 1 and 1337. So why isn't that the case?\\n\\nWait, the problem requires that x and y satisfy l ≤ x < y ≤r, and LCM(x,y) is between l and r. But the LCM in this case (1,2) is 2, which is between 1 and 1337. So why isn't that the answer? The sample output for the first test case is 6 7. But according to this approach, there's a valid pair. So perhaps the sample is wrong. Wait, no. Let me check the sample input again.\\n\\nWait the sample input for the first test case is 1 and 1337. The output is 6 7. So LCM(6,7) is 42, which is between 1 and 1337. So that's a valid pair. But according to the logic of x and 2x, 1 and 2 is also a valid pair. So why isn't that the answer? Because the problem allows any valid pair, but the code can output any of them. So the sample output is just one possible solution.\\n\\nBut in that case, why does the sample output not choose the minimal x and y? Because perhaps the code's approach was to pick x and x+1 when possible. But in any case, the problem allows any valid pair.\\n\\nSo perhaps the initial approach of checking if 2*l <= r is the way to go. Because that would give a valid pair.\\n\\nSo for any test case where 2*l <= r, the answer would be l and 2*l.\\n\\nBut wait, the first sample input's l is 1, 2*l is 2. So the pair (1,2) would have LCM 2. Which is valid. So why isn't that the answer in the sample output? Because the sample output is 6 7, which is another valid pair. But the problem states that any valid pair is acceptable.\\n\\nSo perhaps the sample is just showing another possible solution. So the code can output any pair as long as it's valid.\\n\\nSo the key insight is that if 2*l <= r, then the pair (l, 2*l) is valid. So that's a very quick check, and can be done in O(1) per test case. But what about cases where 2*l > r? For example, the third sample input is 2 4. 2*2=4 is equal to r, so the pair (2,4) is valid.\\n\\nBut in the case where l is 3 and r is 5: 3*2=6>5. So we can't do that. So we need to find another pair.\\n\\nIn such cases, perhaps we can look for consecutive even numbers, like 3 and 4. LCM(3,4) is 12, which is larger than 5. So that's no good.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the pair (3,5). LCM(15) which is 15, which is larger than 5. No.\\n\\nHmm. So in this case, the answer is impossible. So how to handle cases where 2*l > r.\\n\\nAnother example: l=88, r=89 (the last test case in the sample). So possible pairs are 88 and 89. LCM is 88*89 = 7832, which is way bigger than r (89). So no pair exists. So output -1 -1.\\n\\nSo what's the condition when there's no solution?\\n\\nIf for all pairs x < y in [l, r], the LCM(x,y) is > r. So when is that possible?\\n\\nThe LCM of x and y is at least y (since y is a multiple of x's divisor). So the minimal possible LCM is y. So for the LCM to be <= r, y must be <= r, which it already is. But LCM is y only if x divides y. So if there's no pair x < y where x divides y, then the LCM of x and y will be at least the minimal multiple that's divisible by both, which could be greater than r.\\n\\nSo how to find such a pair when 2*l > r.\\n\\nWait, but if 2*l > r, then l and r are consecutive numbers. For example, l=3, r=5. Then possible pairs are (3,4), (3,5), (4,5).\\n\\nTheir LCMs are:\\n\\n3 and4:12>5.\\n\\n3 and5:15>5.\\n\\n4 and5:20>5.\\n\\nSo output is -1 -1.\\n\\nBut how to find a valid pair when possible.\\n\\nAnother example: l=5, r=6.\\n\\nPossible pairs: (5,6). LCM is 30>6. So output is -1-1.\\n\\nAnother example: l=4, r=5. Pair (4,5) LCM is 20>5. No solution.\\n\\nWait, but what if the pair is (4,5). LCM is 20>5. So no.\\n\\nHmm.\\n\\nSo when 2*l > r, the only possible pairs are consecutive numbers. But their LCM is x*(x+1) if they are coprime, which would be larger than r.\\n\\nSo in such cases, the only possible way to have LCM(x,y) <= r is if y is a multiple of x, but since x >= l, and y =x *k. But since 2x > r, then x must be larger than r/2. So y would be x *2, but x is at least r/2 +1 (since x >= l and l > r/2). So x*2 would be larger than r. So there's no possible multiple.\\n\\nSo in this case, the answer is impossible.\\n\\nThus, the conclusion is: if 2*l <= r, then there exists a pair (l, 2*l) which is valid. Otherwise, check if there's any pair where one is a multiple of the other. But if 2*l > r, then even the minimal possible multiple (x*2) would be larger than r, so no possible pairs. Hence, in such cases, the answer is -1-1.\\n\\nWait, but wait. What if l=3, r=6. Then 2*3=6 <=6. So the pair (3,6) has LCM 6 which is between 3 and 6. So output 3 6.\\n\\nYes. So the condition is if 2*l <= r, then output l and 2*l. Otherwise, check if there exists any pair x, y where y is a multiple of x. But when 2*l > r, it's possible that l is 5 and r is 10. Then 2*5=10, which is <=10. So the pair (5,10) is valid.\\n\\nWait, but in that case, 2*l is 10, which equals r. So the condition 2*l <= r is satisfied. So the code would output 5 and 10.\\n\\nSo the initial approach of checking 2*l <= r seems sufficient.\\n\\nSo the algorithm could be:\\n\\nFor each test case:\\n\\n- if 2*l <= r: output l and 2*l.\\n\\n- else: check if there exists any x and y in [l, r] where x < y and LCM(x,y) <= r.\\n\\nBut when 2*l > r, then the possible x and y must be such that y is a multiple of x and y <= r.\\n\\nBut since x >= l, and y is a multiple of x (>= x*2), but x*2 >= 2*l. But 2*l > r, so x*2 > r. Hence, y can't be a multiple of x. So in such cases, there are no possible pairs. Hence, output -1-1.\\n\\nWait, but wait. Let's take l=3, r=5. Then 2*3=6>5. So according to the initial approach, we output -1-1. Which is correct.\\n\\nAnother example: l=5, r=10. 2*5=10 <=10. So output 5 and 10.\\n\\nSo the initial approach seems correct.\\n\\nSo the steps for each test case:\\n\\nCheck if 2*l <= r. If yes, output l and 2*l.\\n\\nElse, check if there exists any pair (x, x+1) where their LCM is <= r. But how?\\n\\nWait, when 2*l > r, but l and r are consecutive. For example, l=3, r=4. Then possible pairs are (3,4). LCM is 12>4. So no.\\n\\nAnother example: l=2, r=3. 2*2=4>3. So check if any pairs. (2,3) has LCM 6>3. So output -1-1.\\n\\nBut wait, in the sample input's third test case, l=2, r=4. 2*2=4<=4. So output 2 and4.\\n\\nSo the initial approach works.\\n\\nBut the sample input's first test case: l=1, r=1337. 2*1=2 <=1337. So output 1 and 2. But the sample output is 6 and7.\\n\\nBut according to the problem statement, any valid pair is acceptable. So why does the sample output choose a different pair? Because the code can output any valid pair, and 1 and 2 is a valid pair. So why isn't that the sample's answer?\\n\\nWait, looking at the sample input's first output line: 6 7. The LCM is 6*7=42 (since they are coprime). Which is between 1 and 1337. So that's valid. But according to the approach of outputting l and 2*l, the answer would be 1 and 2. So why isn't that the sample's output? Because the problem allows any pair. So perhaps the sample's answer is just one possible solution, and the code can output any pair.\\n\\nSo the initial approach of checking if 2*l <= r would output a valid pair. Hence, the code can be written as:\\n\\nFor each test case:\\n\\nIf 2*l <= r: output l and 2*l.\\n\\nElse: output -1 -1.\\n\\nBut wait, there's a case where 2*l > r, but there's another pair that works.\\n\\nWait, let's take l=3 and r=6. 2*3=6 <=6. So output 3 and6.\\n\\nAnother example: l=4, r=6. 2*4=8>6. So according to the code, output -1-1. But possible pairs are (4,6). LCM is 12>6. So no. So code is correct.\\n\\nAnother case: l=3, r=7. 2*3=6<=7. Output 3,6. Which is valid.\\n\\nBut what if l=5 and r=10. 2*5=10 <=10. Output 5 and10.\\n\\nBut what if l=5 and r=9. Then 2*5=10>9. So code would output -1-1. But possible pairs? For example, 5 and 6. LCM is 30>9. No. 6 and 8: LCM is 24>9. So no. So code is correct.\\n\\nSo in all cases, the code would output a valid pair if 2*l <= r, else -1-1. Because when 2*l > r, there are no possible pairs where one is a multiple of the other, and other pairs have LCMs that are larger than r.\\n\\nBut wait, is there a case where 2*l > r but there exists a pair where LCM is <= r?\\n\\nLet's think. Suppose l=6, r=10. 2*6=12>10. So code says output -1-1. But possible pairs:\\n\\n6 and 9: LCM is 18>10. No.\\n\\n6 and 8: LCM 24>10.\\n\\n7 and 8: LCM 56>10.\\n\\nNo pairs. So code is correct.\\n\\nAnother example: l=3, r=7. 2*3=6<=7. So code outputs 3 and6.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnother example: l=7, r=14. 2*7=14 <=14. So code outputs 7 and14. LCM is 14, which is between 7 and14.\\n\\nSo correct.\\n\\nSo this approach seems to cover all possible valid cases.\\n\\nThus, the code can be written as:\\n\\nFor each test case, read l and r.\\n\\nIf l *2 <= r:\\n\\n    print l and 2*l.\\n\\nElse:\\n\\n    print -1 -1.\\n\\nBut wait, let's look at the sample input's third test case:\\n\\nInput is 2 4. So l=2, r=4. 2*2=4 <=4. So code outputs 2 and4. Which matches the sample.\\n\\nSample input's fourth test case: 88 89. 88*2=176>89. So code outputs -1-1. Which matches the sample.\\n\\nThe second sample input is 13 69. 13*2=26 <=69. So code outputs 13 and26. But sample output is 14 and21. So why the discrepancy?\\n\\nWait, the sample output for the second test case is 14 21. Their LCM is LCM(14,21) = 42, which is between 13 and69. So it's a valid pair. But according to the code, the output is 13 and26, which also have LCM 26, which is between 13 and69. So the code's answer is correct. The sample is just another valid pair.\\n\\nThus, the code's approach is correct.\\n\\nTherefore, the solution is to check if 2*l <=r. If yes, output l and 2*l. Else, output -1-1.\\n\\nThus, the code can be written as:\\n\\nRead t test cases.\\n\\nFor each test case:\\n\\nl, r = map(int, input().split())\\n\\nif 2 * l <= r:\\n\\n    print(l, 2*l)\\n\\nelse:\\n\\n    print(-1, -1)\\n\\nBut wait, there's a possible edge case when l is 0.

Your task is to perform necessary operations and measurements to figure out which state it was and to return 0 if it was GHZ state or 1 if it was W state.

The problem is to determine whether a given set of N qubits (N between 2 and 8) is in the GHZ state or the W state. We need to perform operations and measurements to figure out which one it is. The answer should return 0 for GHZ and 1 for W.\\n\\nHmm, so first, I need to remember the properties of the GHZ and W states. Let\\'s think about their structures.\\n\\nThe GHZ state is a superposition of all 0s and all 1s. So when measured in the computational basis, all qubits will be the same. So if we measure each qubit, they either all collapse to 0 or all to 1. But since it\\'s a superposition, each possibility has a 50% chance. So if we check all qubits after a single measurement, they should all be the same. But how can we use this?\\n\\nThe W state is a uniform superposition of all states with exactly one 1 and the rest 0s. So when measured, exactly one qubit will be 1, the others 0. But since it\\'s a symmetric state, each qubit has an equal probability of being the 1. So for each qubit, the probability of being 1 is 1/N. So when we measure all qubits, there will be exactly one 1 in the outcome.\\n\\nSo the key difference is: for GHZ state, all qubits are same (all 0 or all 1) upon measurement. For W state, exactly one qubit is 1, others 0.\\n\\nBut wait, when you measure the GHZ state, after measurement, all qubits will collapse to the same state. So the measurement outcomes would all be 0 or all 1. So if after measuring all qubits, they are either all 0 or all 1, then it\\'s GHZ. Otherwise, if exactly one is 1, it\\'s W. But what if there\\'s some other combination? Like two 1s. Then that can\\'t happen in either case. So in that case, perhaps the algorithm can return either, but since the input is guaranteed to be either GHZ or W, any outcome that\\'s not all same or exactly one 1 must not be possible. Wait, but the problem states that the input is guaranteed to be one of the two. So when we perform a measurement, if the result is all 0s or all 1s, then it\\'s GHZ. If exactly one 1, it\\'s W. But what if, for example, in the GHZ state, when you measure, you get all 0s. Then you know it\\'s GHZ. But if you get all 1s, same. However, in the W state, any measurement outcome must have exactly one 1. So the approach would be to measure all qubits. If all are same, return 0. Else, if exactly one is 1, return 1.\\n\\nWait, but how can that be? Because in the W state, when measured, you must get exactly one 1. So if after measurement, that\\'s the case, then it\\'s W. Otherwise, it\\'s GHZ. But wait, when you measure the GHZ state, there\\'s a 50% chance of all 0s and 50% all 1s. So any other outcome (like some 0s and some 1s) is impossible. So in that case, the measurement outcome directly tells us the answer.\\n\\nSo the algorithm could be: measure all qubits. If all are 0 or all are 1 → GHZ. Otherwise, check if exactly one is 1 → W.\\n\\nBut how do we check that in the quantum code? Because once we measure the qubits, their state collapses. But in the problem, the input state is either GHZ or W, so any outcome not allowed by the state\\'s possible measurements can\\'t happen.\\n\\nSo the approach is to measure each qubit. If all measurements are 0 → GHZ. All 1 → GHZ. Otherwise, check if exactly one is 1 → then W.\\n\\nBut the problem is that the measurement could return a mix, which would indicate GHZ is not possible. So the algorithm can be:\\n\\n- Measure all qubits once.\\n\\n- If all are same → return 0 (GHZ).\\n\\n- Else, if exactly one is 1 → return 1 (W).\\n\\nBut wait, how can that happen? Because if the state is GHZ, then the measurement can\\'t have a mix. So in that case, any mix would imply it\\'s W. But in the W state, the only possible measurement outcome is exactly one 1. So if the measurement result has exactly one 1, it\\'s W. Otherwise, it\\'s impossible. Wait, no. Wait, the W state allows exactly one 1. So if after measurement, you have two 1s, that\\'s impossible. But the problem states that the input is guaranteed to be either GHZ or W. So when that happens, which state is it? Well, it\\'s impossible. But according to the problem statement, the input is always either GHZ or W. So in reality, such a case (like two 1s) cannot occur. So maybe the algorithm can just check for the GHZ condition first, and if not, assume it\\'s W.\\n\\nSo the steps would be:\\n\\n1. Measure all qubits.\\n\\n2. If all are 0 or all are 1 → return 0.\\n\\n3. Else → return 1.\\n\\nBecause for the W state, the only possible outcome is exactly one 1, which would not be all same. So the code can be written as: after measuring, check if all bits are same. If yes, GHZ. Otherwise, W.\\n\\nBut wait, suppose in the W state, after measurement, exactly one qubit is 1. Then the other N-1 are 0. So the all-same check would fail (since most are 0, one is 1). So in that case, the code returns 1.\\n\\nFor GHZ state, after measurement, all are same. So code returns 0.\\n\\nSo this approach would work.\\n\\nBut how to implement this in Q#?\\n\\nIn Q#, to measure the qubits, we can use M(q) for each qubit in the array. Then collect the results and check.\\n\\nSo for example:\\n\\noperation Solve (qs : Qubit[]) : Int {\\n    // measure all qubits\\n    mutable result = 0;\\n    let measurements = ForEach(M, qs);\\n    let first = measurements[0];\\n    mutable allSame = true;\\n    for m in measurements {\\n        if m != first {\\n            set allSame = false;\\n        }\\n    }\\n    if allSame {\\n        return 0;\\n    } else {\\n        return 1;\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nWait, but wait. Let\\'s think again. For the W state, the measurement will result in exactly one 1. So when we take the measurements, exactly one is 1. So the code will check if all are same. Since one is 1 and others are 0, allSame is false, so return 1.\\n\\nFor the GHZ state, the measurements are all 0 or all 1. So allSame is true, return 0.\\n\\nYes, that seems correct.\\n\\nBut is there any case where this approach could fail?\\n\\nHmm, for example, if the GHZ state is measured as all 0 or all 1. So the code works.\\n\\nBut wait, the problem statement says that the input is guaranteed to be one of the two states. So the code doesn\\'t have to handle any other cases. So this approach is correct.\\n\\nTherefore, the solution is to measure all qubits, check if all are the same. If yes, GHZ (return 0). Else, W (return 1).\\n\\nBut wait, in Q#, when you measure a qubit, you get a Result which is either Zero or One. So in the code, the measurements are stored in a list of Results. So the code checks if all are the same as the first measurement.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nSo this is the correct approach.\\n\\nNow, the code for Q# is as I wrote.\\n\\nBut the problem is to translate this into Python, but the original problem is in Q#. Wait, no. Wait, the user provided a Q# code skeleton and wants a Python solution? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the code should be written in Q#, as per the signature given. But the user is asking for a Python solution. Wait, the problem statement says that the code must read from input and write to output. But the problem seems to be a quantum computing problem. Hmm, wait, perhaps there\\'s a mistake here.\\n\\nWait, the problem says that you have to implement an operation in Q#, but the user\\'s solution requires Python. That\\'s conflicting. Wait, perhaps the problem description is incorrect. Let me re-read the problem statement.\\n\\nThe problem says:\\n\\nYour code should have the following signature:\\n\\nnamespace Solution {\\n    open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;\\n    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;\\n    operation Solve (qs : Qubit[]) : Int\\n    {\\n        body\\n        {\\n            // your code here\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nBut the user says that the solution must read input from standard input and write output to standard output, using Python\\'s print() and input(). But this is impossible because the problem is a quantum computing problem. This is conflicting.\\n\\nWait, perhaps there\\'s a mistake here. The original problem is probably from a Quantum Computing competition (like Microsoft\\'s Q# coding contests), but the user is now asking for a Python solution. But the problem is impossible to solve in Python, because Python cannot simulate quantum operations. So this must be a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the user is confused and the actual problem is to simulate this in a classical way.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps this is a mistake in the problem statement, and the user intended to ask for a classical algorithm that can distinguish between the two states based on measurement outcomes.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a code submission in Q#, but the user is asking for an explanation and code in Python. But that\\'s not possible.\\n\\nWait, the problem\\'s input says None, output says None. So perhaps the actual problem is not to read any input, but to write the Q# code. But the user is now asking for Python code that reads from input and writes to output. That\\'s conflicting.\\n\\nThis suggests that there\\'s a mix-up in the problem statement.\\n\\nBut given that the user provided a code snippet for Q# and requires a Python solution, perhaps this is a mistake, and the actual problem is to write code in Q#. But the user\\'s instructions are conflicting.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps this is a problem from a quantum programming contest, but the user wants to see an explanation and code in Python. But that\\'s impossible.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a classical simulation of the quantum scenario. But how?\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to return 0 if the state is GHZ and 1 if it\\'s W, based on measurement outcomes. The solution would be to perform measurements in a certain way to determine the state with high probability.\\n\\nBut in the problem statement, the code must return the correct answer with certainty. Because the problem states that the input is guaranteed to be one of the two states. So the solution must correctly distinguish them with 100% accuracy.\\n\\nThe approach I outlined earlier (measure all qubits, check if all same) does exactly that. Because for GHZ, measuring all qubits gives all same. For W, the measurements are exactly one 1. So the code would return the correct answer.\\n\\nBut wait, what if in the W state, after measurement, you have exactly one 1. Then the code returns 1. Correct.\\n\\nIn the GHZ state, you get all 0s or all 1s. Then code returns 0. Correct.\\n\\nSo this approach works.\\n\\nTherefore, the code in Q# would be as I wrote. But the user is asking for a Python solution, which is impossible. Unless this is a code submission for a problem that simulates this scenario.\\n\\nWait, perhaps the problem is being presented in a way where the Python code is supposed to model the quantum operations. But this is not standard. Alternatively, perhaps there\\'s a misunderstanding here. But the user\\'s problem is from a quantum programming competition, but they are asking for a Python solution, which is impossible. Unless the Python code is supposed to simulate the quantum state and the measurement process.\\n\\nBut that\\'s not feasible for N up to 8, given the time constraints. For example, simulating the quantum state would require handling 2^8=256 amplitudes. But the problem\\'s time limit is 1 second, and the code must process the largest possible test case (N=8). But in Python, even for N=8, simulating the state is possible, but perhaps the code is supposed to find a way to determine the state without simulation.\\n\\nBut how?\\n\\nWait, the problem is to determine whether the given state is GHZ or W. The Python code is to read input and output 0 or 1. But since there is no input, the code must somehow model the quantum operations. But this is impossible unless the code is a classical simulation of the quantum process.\\n\\nBut the user\\'s problem says that the code must read from input and write to output. But the input is None, according to the problem\\'s input format.\\n\\nThis is very confusing. It\\'s possible that there\\'s a mistake in the problem statement. Perhaps the user intended to present a quantum problem but by mistake replaced the code template with a Python one. Alternatively, the problem is a classical one that mirrors the quantum problem.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a classical problem where the input is a list of qubits\\' states, but this is not clear.\\n\\nBut given that the problem statement mentions the GHZ and W states, which are quantum states, it\\'s likely that the original problem is intended to be solved using quantum operations (i.e., in Q#). However, the user has erroneously asked for a Python solution. But since the problem requires quantum operations, a Python solution is not feasible. Unless the code is intended to output 0 or 1 based on some classical calculation.\\n\\nBut this is impossible to determine without clarification.\\n\\nBut perhaps the user made a mistake and the correct code is in Q#, and the Python code block is a formatting error. However, given the user\\'s instructions, they expect a Python solution.\\n\\nThis is a contradiction.\\n\\nAssuming that the user intended to ask for a Q# solution, but in the problem statement\\'s code block, the code is written in Python, perhaps the correct approach is to write the Q# code as per the problem statement.\\n\\nBut the user\\'s instructions are conflicting. The problem statement\\'s code is in Q#, but the user is asking for Python code. There\\'s a mistake here. Therefore, perhaps the user intended to present a classical problem, but described it in terms of quantum states.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps this is a problem where the solution is to return 0 or 1 based on a specific condition that can be determined classically. For example, the number of 1s in the measured qubits.\\n\\nBut given that the problem is to distinguish between the two quantum states, the solution is to measure all qubits and check if they are all the same.\\n\\nSo in Python, perhaps the code is supposed to read the measurement outcomes and return 0 or 1 accordingly. But since there\\'s no input, how can that be?\\n\\nThis is very unclear. But given the problem\\'s input and output format, which are None, perhaps the code is supposed to be a function that simulates the quantum measurement process. But again, in Python, this would be challenging.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to determine the minimum number of measurements required to distinguish the two states, and the Python code is to output 0 or 1 based on some calculation. But without any input, this is not possible.\\n\\nGiven this confusion, I think there\\'s a mistake in the problem statement. The user probably intended to present a quantum problem to be solved in Q#, but the code block is Python. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a classical problem where the code has to determine the state based on certain parameters. But without input, this is impossible.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the user has mixed up two different problems. For example, the problem\\'s description is for a quantum problem, but the code submission is for a classical problem, which reads input and outputs 0 or 1. But how?\\n\\nIn any case, given the user\\'s instructions to write a Python solution that reads from input and writes to output, and given the problem\\'s description, perhaps the problem is to simulate the quantum measurement process and determine the correct answer.\\n\\nBut how can we simulate the quantum state in Python?\\n\\nThe GHZ state is a superposition of all 0s and all 1s. When measured, all qubits will be in 0 or all in 1, each with 50% probability.\\n\\nThe W state is a superposition of all states with exactly one 1. When measured, exactly one qubit is 1, others are 0, with each such state having equal probability.\\n\\nSo, to simulate the measurement process, the Python code would generate a random measurement outcome based on the actual state (GHZ or W), and then determine which state it was. But since the code is supposed to return 0 or 1 based on the actual state, which is not known to the code, this approach is impossible.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to write a function that, given a quantum state (either GHZ or W), can be measured to determine which it is, and return 0 or 1 accordingly.\\n\\nBut again, the code must process no input, as per the problem\\'s input format.\\n\\nThis is very confusing. Given the conflicting information, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem statement, and the correct solution is the Q# code as outlined earlier.\\n\\nBut since the user insists on a Python solution that reads input and writes output, perhaps this is a mistake, and the correct approach is to write the Q# code as described.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to return 0 or 1 based on the number of 1s in the measured qubits. For example, in the GHZ state, the number of 1s is either 0 or N, while in the W state, it\\'s exactly 1.\\n\\nBut in Python, how would the code know which state it is, given that there is no input? The problem states that the code must return 0 or 1 based on the state, but without any input, this is impossible.\\n\\nGiven all this confusion, I think there\\'s a mistake in the problem statement, and the correct solution is the Q# code I described earlier. However, since the user is asking for Python code, perhaps this is a mistake and the intended solution is to return 0 or 1 based on the measurement outcome.\\n\\nBut in Python, there\\'s no way to interact with quantum states. So perhaps the problem is to generate a classical simulation, where the code uses random numbers to simulate the measurement outcomes of either state and then determines which state it is.\\n\\nBut even this requires knowing which state is being simulated, which is not possible.\\n\\nIn conclusion, given the problem\\'s description, the correct solution is to measure all qubits and check if they are all the same. If yes, return 0 (GHZ), else return 1 (W). The Q# code for this is as follows:\\n\\noperation Solve (qs : Qubit[]) : Int {\\n    mutable isGhz = true;\\n    let m0 = M(qs[0]);\\n    for q in qs {\\n        if M(q) != m0 {\\n            set isGhz = false;\\n        }\\n    }\\n    return isGhz ? 0 | 1;\\n}\\n\\nBut the user\\'s instructions require a Python solution, which is impossible for a quantum problem. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem statement. Perhaps the user intended to provide a classical problem, but it\\'s presented as a quantum one.\\n\\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the correct way to proceed is to provide the Q# code as the solution, as per the problem\\'s original code template, even though the user\\'s instructions ask for Python. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a classical one that\\'s inspired by the quantum scenario.\\n\\nAssuming that the problem is a classical problem where the code must determine whether the given qubits are in GHZ or W state based on certain measurements, but without any input. But how?\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to output 0 or 1 based on some computation that can be done classically, such as checking parity or the number of 1s in the measured outcomes.\\n\\nBut I\\'m stuck. Given the time constraints, I think the correct approach is to provide the Q# code that measures all qubits and returns 0 if all are same, else 1. However, the user\\'s instructions require Python code. Therefore, this is a contradiction.\\n\\nGiven that the user\\'s problem is to write Python code, perhaps they made a mistake and the code should be in Q#. But the user\\'s instruction says to provide Python code. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to be a classical simulation, and the code must output 0 or 1 based on a measurement simulation.\\n\\nBut since there is no input, the code would need to generate a measurement outcome based on one of the two states and then return the answer. But that\\'s impossible because the code is supposed to determine which state it is, not generate a measurement.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to return 0 or 1 with probabilities that allow distinguishing the two states. But the problem requires the code to return the correct answer with certainty.\\n\\nIn summary, the correct solution to the quantum problem is to measure all qubits and check if they are all same, which gives 0 for GHZ and 1 for W. The corresponding Q# code is as described. However, the user\\'s instructions for Python code are conflicting. Therefore, assuming that the user made a mistake and intended to ask for Q# code, but provided a Python code template, the solution is as follows.\\n</think>\\n\\n```python\\n# The problem is inherently quantum and requires a Q# solution.

Let's think through how to approach this.\\n\\nFirst, the goal is to minimize the absolute difference between the sums of the two groups. Let's start by calculating the total sum of numbers from 1 to n. The total sum S is n*(n+1)/2. The problem then reduces to finding a subset of these numbers whose sum is as close as possible to S/2. Because if one group's sum is as close to S/2 as possible, the other group's sum will also be close, and their difference will be minimized.\\n\\nSo the optimal difference is either 0 (if S is even and such a subset exists) or 1 (if S is odd). Wait, but maybe even when S is even, it's possible that the sum can't reach exactly S/2. But given that the numbers are 1 to n, which is a consecutive sequence, there's probably a way to split them when possible.\\n\\nLet's think about the parity of the sum. The sum S is n(n+1)/2. If S is even, then we can split into two subsets with sum S/2 each, leading to a difference of 0. If S is odd, the best possible is a difference of 1.\\n\\nBut how to find such a subset?\\n\\nLet's consider when S is even. We need to find a subset with sum S/2. For example, in the first sample input where n=4, the total sum is 10, which is even. The required subset sum is 5. The sample solution uses 1 and 4, which adds to 5. Similarly, 2 and 3 would also work.\\n\\nSo the key is to find such a subset. How can we do this efficiently for large n (up to 60,000)?\\n\\nA dynamic programming approach for subset sum is out of the question here because n is up to 60,000, which would make the DP approach O(n * S) which would be way too slow. For example, S can be as big as 60,000 * 60,001 / 2 ≈ 1.8e9. So even O(n^2) is not feasible here.\\n\\nTherefore, we need a greedy approach. Let's think if there's a pattern or a way to construct the subset.\\n\\nLet's consider that the numbers are 1 to n. Maybe we can start by trying to take the largest numbers first and see if adding them brings us closer to the target sum (S/2). Alternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical way to find the required subset.\\n\\nAnother approach: Let's think about whether it's possible to partition the numbers into two subsets with equal sum when S is even.\\n\\nIf S is even, then the target sum is T = S/2. We need to select some numbers that add up to T. Let's see if such a selection exists.\\n\\nAn observation here: For n >= 2, when the total sum is even, there's always a way to split the numbers into two subsets with sum T. How?\\n\\nWait, for example, when n is even, perhaps arranging the numbers in pairs. Like 1 and n, 2 and n-1, etc. Each pair sums to n+1. Then, if there are k pairs, each of sum n+1, then total sum is k*(n+1). But the total sum is also n(n+1)/2. So for even n, the sum is n/2 * (n+1). So when n is even, the sum is even only if (n+1) is even, i.e., when n is odd. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\\n\\nWait, the sum S = n(n+1)/2. For S to be even, n(n+1) must be divisible by 4. Because n and n+1 are consecutive, one of them is even. So either n is even, then n is divisible by 2, and n+1 is odd. So for S to be even, the product n*(n+1) must be divisible by 4, which happens if either n is divisible by 4 or n+1 is divisible by 4.\\n\\nSo when n mod 4 is 0 or 3, then S is even. For example, n=4: 4*5=20 → 20/2=10 even. n=3: 3*4=12 → 12/2=6 even. So S is even when n ≡ 0 mod 4 or n ≡ 3 mod 4.\\n\\nIn those cases, the target sum T is S/2. How to find a subset that sums to T?\\n\\nLet me think of the approach used in the sample. For n=4:\\n\\nWe need to select numbers that add up to 5. The solution was 1 and 4. Alternatively, 2 and 3. So perhaps the approach is to pair numbers from the ends.\\n\\nAnother example: n=3. S=6. T=3. The subset could be 3, or 1+2. So for n=3, possible.\\n\\nLet me think of n=5. S=15. Since S is odd, the difference is 1, so the minimum possible is 1. So the answer in that case would be 1. But for even S, when n is 5, that's not the case. Wait, n=5: sum is 15, which is odd. So difference must be 1.\\n\\nBut when n is 7, sum is 28, which is even. So target is 14. How to split?\\n\\nPossible subsets: 7 + 6 + 1 = 14? Let's see 7+6=13, plus 1 makes 14. Then the remaining numbers are 2,3,4,5. Sum is 2+3+4+5=14. So that works. So subset is 1,6,7.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here.\\n\\nAnother approach is to greedily add numbers starting from the largest possible and see if adding them helps reach the target.\\n\\nLet's think of the algorithm:\\n\\n1. Compute S = n(n+1)/2.\\n\\n2. If S is odd, the minimum difference is 1, and we can split the numbers such that one group has sum (S-1)/2 and the other (S+1)/2.\\n\\n   But how to construct the subset for this case?\\n\\nWait, perhaps when S is even, we need to split into two equal parts. When it's odd, the difference is 1.\\n\\nBut regardless of that, the problem is to find a subset whose sum is as close as possible to S/2.\\n\\nBut for the code, perhaps the first step is to determine whether the sum is even or odd. Then compute the target sum (floor(S/2) or ceiling(S/2) depending on parity). Then find a subset whose sum is that target.\\n\\nBut how to find such a subset efficiently.\\n\\nAlternative idea for even S:\\n\\nIf n is even:\\n\\nWait, perhaps when n is divisible by 4, the numbers can be partitioned into two groups with equal sum. For example, n=4: sum is 10, each group 5. For n=3: sum is 6, each group 3. So perhaps when n mod 4 is 0 or 3, the sum is even.\\n\\nWait, 3 mod 4 is 3, 4 mod 4 is 0.\\n\\nSo when n is congruent to 0 or 3 mod 4, sum is even, and possible to split. Otherwise, sum is odd, and difference is 1.\\n\\nSo the first step is to check the parity of the sum. Then, based on that, the minimal difference is either 0 or 1.\\n\\nBut the main problem is to find the subset of numbers that adds up to T, which is S//2 when S is even, or (S-1)/2 when S is odd.\\n\\nBut how?\\n\\nLet's think of the case when S is even. For example, n=7: sum is 28, T=14.\\n\\nWe need to find a subset of numbers 1-7 that sum to 14.\\n\\nOne possible approach is to start adding the largest possible numbers until we reach T.\\n\\nTake 7. Now current sum is 7. Remaining needed is 7. Next largest is 6: 7+6=13. Remaining needed 1. Take 1. Total sum 14.\\n\\nSo subset is {1,6,7}.\\n\\nAnother approach is to think of it as a greedy selection. Let's collect numbers from the end, and see if adding them brings us closer to the target.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern when n is 0 mod 4 or 3 mod 4.\\n\\nLet me think about when n mod 4 is 0.\\n\\nTake n=4: sum 10. T=5. The subset is 1 and 4. So sum 5.\\n\\nn=8: sum is 36. T=18.\\n\\nHow to split? Let's see. 8+7+3 = 18? 8+7=15, +3=18. The remaining numbers are 1,2,4,5,6. Sum is 1+2+4+5+6=18. Hmm, that's possible.\\n\\nAnother approach for n mod 4 ==0: group the numbers into pairs (1,4), (2,3), (5,8), (6,7), etc. Each pair sums to 5 (for the first pair). Wait, perhaps this is a general approach.\\n\\nWait, for n=4, the pairs (1,4) and (2,3) sum to 5 each. So take one pair from each group. For example, take 1 and 4 from the first pair and 3 from the second pair. Wait, no. Wait, for n=4, the sum is 10. So each group needs to sum to 5. The pairs are (1,4) and (2,3), each sum to 5. So taking one pair as a group would work. So group1 is {1,4}, group2 {2,3}.\\n\\nSimilarly, for n=8: the pairs would be (1,8), (2,7), (3,6), (4,5). Each pair sums to 9. There are 4 pairs. The total sum is 4*9=36. So group1 would take two pairs, sum 18. For example, take (1,8) and (4,5) → 9 +9 =18. So group1 is {1,8,4,5}.\\n\\nSo the approach here is to split the numbers into pairs (i, n+1 -i). Each pair sums to n+1. Then, for even n (n mod 4 ==0), the total pairs are n/2, each sum to n+1. So group1 takes half of the pairs, which is (n/2)/2 pairs. Wait, for n=4, pairs are 2. Take 1 pair. For n=8, pairs are 4. Take 2 pairs.\\n\\nSo group1 would consist of the first k pairs, where k is (n/2)/2. Wait, maybe this is a way to split.\\n\\nSimilarly, when n mod 4 ==3. For example, n=3. sum is 6, T=3. The possible subset is 3 or 1+2. So for n=3 mod4, perhaps the approach is to split into pairs but leave some numbers.\\n\\nWait, let's think for n=7. sum is 28 → T=14. How to split?\\n\\nThe pairs would be (1,7), (2,6), (3,5). That's 3 pairs. The sum of each pair is 8. The remaining number is 4.\\n\\nSo 3 pairs sum to 8*3=24, plus 4 → total sum 28. So to reach T=14, perhaps group1 takes (1,7) and (2,6) sum 8+8=16, which is over. Hmm, not sure.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe when n mod4 ==3, we can take 1, 2, then the pairs as needed.\\n\\nAnother approach for n mod4 ==3:\\n\\nFor example, n=3: group1 is 3. sum 3.\\n\\nn=7: group1 can be 1,2,3,4,4? Wait, no. Let's see. Sum 1+2+3+4=10. Not 14. Wait, perhaps for n=7, group1 is 7,6,1. Sum 7+6=13 +1=14.\\n\\nSo the approach here is to take the largest possible numbers first, then adjust with smaller ones.\\n\\nSo perhaps the general approach is:\\n\\nIf S is even (i.e., n mod4 is 0 or 3):\\n\\nWe need to select numbers such that their sum is T = S/2.\\n\\nThe algorithm can be:\\n\\n- Start from the largest number and greedily pick as long as adding it doesn't exceed T.\\n\\nBut this might not always work. Let's test for n=7.\\n\\nT=14. Current sum is 0.\\n\\nTake 7 → sum 7. Remaining 7.\\n\\nNext take 6 → sum 13. Remaining 1.\\n\\nTake 1 → sum 14. So group1 is {1,6,7}.\\n\\nAnother example, n=4: sum 10 → T=5.\\n\\nTake 4 → sum 4. Remaining 1.\\n\\nTake 1 → sum 5. So group1 is {1,4}.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nn=3: sum 6 → T=3. Take 3. sum 3.\\n\\nn=5: sum 15 → S is odd. So T=7. Need a subset sum of 7. Let's see:\\n\\nTake 5 → sum 5. Remaining 2.\\n\\nTake 2 → sum 7. So group1 is {2,5}. Sum 7. The other group is 1,3,4 → sum 8. Difference is 1.\\n\\nSo for S odd, the difference is 1, which is correct.\\n\\nSo the algorithm could be:\\n\\nCompute S = n(n+1)/2.\\n\\nIf S is even:\\n\\n   T = S//2\\n\\n   Find a subset of numbers from 1 to n that sums to T.\\n\\nElse:\\n\\n   T = (S-1) // 2\\n\\n   Find a subset that sums to T.\\n\\nBut how to find such a subset efficiently.\\n\\nThe approach for even S (n mod4 0 or 3):\\n\\nStart from the largest number and subtract from T, adding to the subset until T is zero.\\n\\nBut this might not always work. Let's see for n=7:\\n\\nT=14.\\n\\nTake 7 → T=7 left. Then take 6 → T=1 left. Then take 1. Sum is 14.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nFor n=8, T=18.\\n\\nStart with 8 → T=10.\\n\\n7 → T=3. Then take 3 → T=0. So subset is 8,7,3. Sum 18.\\n\\nYes. The other group would sum to 18 as well.\\n\\nSo this approach seems to work.\\n\\nSo the algorithm steps would be:\\n\\nInitialize current_sum =0, subset = empty list.\\n\\nStart from i =n down to 1:\\n\\n   if current_sum + i <= T:\\n\\n       add i to subset, current_sum +=i.\\n\\nOnce all numbers are processed, if current_sum == T, done.\\n\\nThis is a greedy approach, and for numbers 1..n, this seems to work.\\n\\nBut why does this work?\\n\\nBecause the numbers are consecutive, and starting from the largest allows us to reach the target sum in the minimal steps.\\n\\nBut let's test for n=5 (S=15, T=7).\\n\\nGreedy approach:\\n\\nTake 5 → sum 5. T left 2.\\n\\nThen 4 → sum 9 (exceeds T). Skip.\\n\\n3: sum 5+3=8 → exceeds. Skip.\\n\\n2: sum 5+2=7 → yes. So subset is 5,2. Sum is 7.\\n\\nSo that works.\\n\\nAnother example, n=6. sum is 21 (S is odd). T=10.\\n\\nWait, no: S=21. T would be 10 (since (21-1)/2=10). So the difference is 1.\\n\\nSo the code needs to find a subset summing to 10.\\n\\nGreedy approach:\\n\\nTake 6 → sum 6. T left 4.\\n\\nTake 5 → sum 11 (exceeds). Skip.\\n\\nTake 4 → 6+4=10. So subset is [6,4]. Sum 10.\\n\\nSo that works.\\n\\nSo the greedy approach seems to work for even and odd S cases.\\n\\nSo the algorithm is:\\n\\nCompute S = n(n+1)/2.\\n\\nIf S is even, target is S//2.\\n\\nElse, target is (S-1)//2.\\n\\nInitialize a list to hold the subset.\\n\\ncurrent_sum =0.\\n\\nIterate from n down to 1:\\n\\n   if current_sum + i <= target:\\n\\n       add i to subset.\\n\\n       current_sum +=i.\\n\\nOnce done, the subset's sum is the target.\\n\\nThis approach will work for all cases.\\n\\nBut why?\\n\\nBecause the numbers are consecutive, and the greedy selection will cover the required sum.\\n\\nIn the case where sum is even, after selecting the largest possible, then the next largest, etc., the remaining sum can be covered by the smaller numbers.\\n\\nSo the code can be written as follows.\\n\\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\\n\\nFirst, compute S.\\n\\nThen compute the target.\\n\\nThen iterate from n down to 1, adding to the subset if possible.\\n\\nOnce the subset is formed, the other group is the remaining numbers.\\n\\nNow, for the output:\\n\\nWe need to print the size of the subset, followed by the elements.\\n\\nBut for large n (up to 60,000), building a list for the subset is feasible as long as we don't do any O(n^2) operations.\\n\\nBut in Python, building a list by appending in a loop is O(n) time, which is acceptable.\\n\\nSo steps for code:\\n\\nRead n.\\n\\nCompute S = n*(n+1)//2.\\n\\nCompute target:\\n\\nif S %2 ==0:\\n\\n    target = S//2\\n\\nelse:\\n\\n    target = (S-1)//2\\n\\ndiff = S - 2*target → which is 0 if even, 1 otherwise.\\n\\nThen, collect the subset.\\n\\nInitialize subset as a list.\\n\\ncurrent_sum =0\\n\\nfor i from n downto 1:\\n\\n    if current_sum +i <= target:\\n\\n        current_sum +=i\\n\\n        subset.append(i)\\n\\nOnce collected, check if current_sum == target.\\n\\nBut since the numbers are consecutive and the algorithm is correct, this should always be true.\\n\\nOnce the subset is formed, output the difference (diff), then the size of the subset followed by the elements.\\n\\nBut wait, in the case of S even, the difference is 0. Else, 1.\\n\\nNow, the code should work for all cases.\\n\\nLet me test with the sample inputs.\\n\\nSample 1: n=4.\\n\\nS=10 even. target=5.\\n\\nIterate from 4 down:\\n\\n4 → sum 4 <=5 → add. sum=4.\\n\\n3 → sum+3=7>5 → skip.\\n\\n2 → sum+2=6>5 → skip.\\n\\n1 → sum+1=5 → add. sum=5.\\n\\nsubset is [4,1]. size 2.

So output is:\\n\\n1\\n\\n1 1 → which matches the sample.\\n\\nAnother test case: n=5. sum 15 → target 7.\\n\\nsubset:\\n\\n5 → sum 5. next 4: 5+4=9>7 → skip. 3: 5+3=8>7 → skip. 2: 5+2=7 → add. sum=7. subset [5,2]. size 2. Output difference 1.\\n\\nAnother example: n=7. sum 28 even. target 14.\\n\\nsubset:7 →7. 6 →13. 5 →13+5=18>14 → skip. 4 →13+4=17>14 → skip. 3 →13+3=16>14 → skip. 2 →13+2=15>14 → skip. 1 →13+1=14 → add. subset [7,6,1]. size 3. sum 14. output difference 0.\\n\\nYes, correct.\\n\\nNow, the code needs to handle n up to 60,000. Building the subset list is O(n) time and O(k) space where k is the size of the subset, which is up to 30,000 elements. That's acceptable.\\n\\nIn Python, appending to a list is O(1) amortized. So the code will be efficient.\\n\\nSo the code steps:\\n\\nRead n.\\n\\nCompute sum and target.\\n\\nCollect the subset.\\n\\nPrint the difference.\\n\\nPrint the subset's size and elements.\\n\\nNow, code:\\n\\nBut how to iterate from n down to 1:\\n\\nIn Python, for i in range(n, 0, -1):\\n\\nSo:\\n\\nsubset = []\\n\\ncurrent_sum =0\\n\\nfor i in range(n, 0, -1):\\n\\n    if current_sum +i <= target:\\n\\n        subset.append(i)\\n\\n        current_sum +=i\\n\\nThen output.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nSo the code should be straightforward.\\n\\nLet's code this.\\n\\nTesting for n=3:\\n\\nsum 6, even. target 3.\\n\\nsubset: 3 → sum 3. So output 0, size 1, element 3. Or wait, the other group is 1,2. But according to the problem statement, both groups must be non-empty. So for n=3, subset is [3]. The other group is 1,2. Both are non-empty. Correct.\\n\\nAnother example, n=1 is not possible as per the constraints (n >=2).\\n\\nSo code seems correct.\\n\\nNow, the code must read n from input, compute, and output.\\n\\nThe code:\\n\\nRead n.\\n\\nCompute S = n*(n+1) // 2.\\n\\nif S %2 ==0:\\n\\n    diff =0\\n\\n    target = S//2\\n\\nelse:\\n\\n    diff =1\\n\\n    target = (S-1)//2\\n\\nsubset = []\\n\\ncurrent =0\\n\\nfor i in range(n, 0, -1):\\n\\n    if current +i <= target:\\n\\n        subset.append(i)\\n\\n        current +=i\\n\\nprint(diff)\\n\\nprint(len(subset), end=' ')\\n\\nprint(' '.join(map(str, subset)))\\n\\nBut wait, in the case where the subset is empty, but according to the problem statement, both groups must be non-empty. But according to the code, the subset will have at least one element, since the target is at least 1 (since when n>=2, the sum S >=3, and when S is even, target is S/2 >= (2*(2+1)/2)/2 = 3/2 → floor 1.5 → but for n=2, sum is 3. So S is odd. target is (3-1)/2=1. The subset is [1]. So correct.\\n\\nBut for the code, when target is 0, but n>=2, which is impossible. So no cases where subset is empty.\\n\\nSo the code is safe.\\n\\nTesting n=2:\\n\\nsubset is [1]. Size 1.

The independent set is a set of vertices where none of them are adjacent. And the goal is to get as large a set as possible. Since the problem says it\\'s okay not to be optimal but to get as many points as possible, I need an efficient heuristic approach that works well for large graphs.\\n\\nFirst, let\\'s think about the constraints. The input graphs can be very big. For example, in the B4 subtask, the graph might have up to 10^5 nodes or even more. So, the solution needs to handle that efficiently in terms of time and memory.\\n\\nThe classic approach for finding a maximal independent set (not maximum) is a greedy algorithm. But which greedy strategy? There are a few possibilities. One common method is to process the vertices in some order (like descending order of degree) and select a vertex if none of its neighbors have been selected yet. Alternatively, there\\'s the approach of repeatedly picking the vertex with the smallest degree, adding it to the set, and removing its neighbors. But maybe there\\'s a better heuristic here.\\n\\nWait, another idea: for each vertex, if it\\'s not adjacent to any selected vertices, add it to the set. But the order in which we process the vertices matters. Processing high-degree vertices first might not be optimal. Because adding a high-degree vertex would exclude many others. Alternatively, maybe processing low-degree vertices first allows more vertices to be added. Hmm.\\n\\nI remember reading that for the maximum independent set problem, which is NP-hard, greedy algorithms can give good approximations. For example, one approach is to select the vertex with the smallest degree, add it to the independent set, and then remove it and all its neighbors. Repeat until the graph is empty. This is called the greedy minimal degree algorithm. This might be a good approach here.\\n\\nLet me think: when you select a vertex of minimal degree, you eliminate that vertex and its neighbors. Since the vertex has minimal degree, it\\'s connected to the fewest possible other vertices. So removing those neighbors (who may have higher degrees) might leave more options for other vertices to be included. This could lead to a larger independent set.\\n\\nSo the plan is:\\n\\n1. Represent the graph efficiently. For each vertex, have a list of its neighbors. But since the graph can be large, we need a way to manage the adjacency lists and track which vertices are still active.\\n\\n2. Use a priority queue (or some structure) to keep track of the current minimal degree vertices. But maintaining the degrees dynamically as vertices are removed could be computationally intensive. Because when a vertex is removed (added to the independent set), all its neighbors are also removed. Each such removal affects the degrees of their neighbors.\\n\\nWait, but perhaps a more efficient approach is needed. Let\\'s outline the steps:\\n\\n- Initialize all vertices as active.\\n- While there are active vertices:\\n   - Find the active vertex with the smallest degree.\\n   - Add it to the independent set.\\n   - Mark it and all its neighbors as inactive.\\n\\nBut how to efficiently track the degrees of active vertices as neighbors are removed?\\n\\nStoring the adjacency lists and a list of active vertices, along with current degrees. But when a vertex is removed (as part of adding to the set or being a neighbor), we need to update the degrees of their neighbors. However, this can be expensive if done naively for large graphs.\\n\\nAlternatively, since once a vertex is removed (either added to the set or as a neighbor), it\\'s no longer considered. So perhaps we can process the vertices in order of their initial degrees, but that\\'s static and might not account for the dynamic changes as vertices are removed. Alternatively, we can recompute the degrees of remaining vertices each time, but that would be O(n) each iteration, leading to O(n^2) time, which is not feasible for large n.\\n\\nHmm. So for very large graphs, this approach might not be feasible. Let\\'s think about the time constraints. For example, a graph with 1e5 vertices and 1e6 edges. The algorithm must run in O(m + n) or O(n log n) time.\\n\\nAnother approach: use a heuristic that processes the vertices in some order and greedily selects each vertex if none of its neighbors have been selected yet. For example, process the vertices in order of increasing degree. But how to implement this efficiently.\\n\\nAlternatively, a simple linear pass through the vertices in a certain order, adding the vertex to the set only if none of its already processed neighbors are in the set. This is a standard greedy approach and runs in O(n + m) time. But the order of processing can significantly affect the result. For example, processing in order of increasing degree (lowest first) might yield a larger set, as choosing a vertex with low degree early on doesn\\'t block too many others.\\n\\nSo the algorithm steps would be:\\n\\n- Sort all vertices in increasing order of degree.\\n- Iterate through the sorted list, and for each vertex, add it to the set if none of its neighbors (who have already been processed) are in the set.\\n\\nWait, but in this approach, since we process vertices in a certain order, when considering a vertex, we check if any of its neighbors that have already been processed (and thus are in the set) would conflict. If none are in the set, we add the current vertex. Since we process in order, once a vertex is added, its neighbors (processed later) won\\'t be added.\\n\\nBut this depends on the order. For example, if you process in reverse order (high degree first), adding a high-degree vertex would prevent all its neighbors from being added. But in the case of low-degree first, adding a low-degree vertex blocks fewer neighbors. So this might lead to a larger set.\\n\\nSo implementing this approach would involve:\\n\\n1. Preprocessing the degrees of each vertex.\\n2. Sorting the vertices in order of increasing degree.\\n3. Iterating through this sorted list, and for each vertex, check if any of its neighbors that have already been considered (processed earlier) are in the set. If not, add it to the set.\\n\\nBut how to efficiently check if any neighbor in the set? Because for each vertex, you have to check all its neighbors, but since you process the vertices in order, the neighbors that are processed after the current vertex are not in the set yet. So when checking, you only need to look at neighbors that have been processed before the current vertex. Wait, no. Because the neighbors could be processed either before or after. For example, if vertex A is processed before vertex B, and A and B are connected. If A is not added to the set, then B can be added. But if A is added, B cannot. So during the processing of B, you check whether any of its neighbors that are already processed (i.e., those with index less than B in the sorted list) have been added to the set.\\n\\nWait, but how to track that. Let\\'s think: the vertices are sorted in some order, say S. For each vertex v in S, we process them one by one. For each v, when considering adding to the set, we check if any of its neighbors that are already in the set. The set is built incrementally. So during processing v, the only neighbors that could be in the set are those that come before v in S and have been processed and added. Because neighbors that come after v in S haven\\'t been processed yet, so they can\\'t be in the set.\\n\\nSo, for each vertex v in the sorted list, when processing it, check all its neighbors. If any neighbor u has been added to the set (i.e., u is in the set and was processed before v), then v cannot be added. Otherwise, add v to the set.\\n\\nBut this requires, for each v, to check all its neighbors. For large graphs, this could be O(m) time. Which is acceptable if m is up to 1e6 or even 1e7. For example, 1e6 edges would take 1e6 operations, which is manageable in Python within 1 second.\\n\\nSo the steps are:\\n\\n- Read the graph, compute degrees for each vertex.\\n- Sort the vertices in increasing order of degree (so low-degree first).\\n- For each vertex in this order:\\n   - Check if any of its neighbors have already been added to the independent set.\\n   - If none are present, add this vertex to the set.\\n\\nThis approach is O(m) time (for checking neighbors) plus O(n log n) for sorting. Which should be acceptable for n up to 1e5.\\n\\nBut wait, when a vertex is processed, we check all its neighbors. For example, a vertex with degree 1000 would require checking 1000 neighbors. For a graph with m edges, this is O(m) in total. So overall, the algorithm is O(n log n + m) time, which is manageable.\\n\\nThis seems like a feasible approach. Let\\'s think about how to implement this.\\n\\nIn Python, we can represent the adjacency list as a list of sets. For each vertex v, adj[v] is a set of its neighbors.\\n\\nWe first compute the degrees. Then, sort the vertices in increasing order of their degree. Then, iterate through each vertex in this order. For each, check if any of its neighbors are already in the set. To track which vertices are in the set, we can use a boolean array (selected) where selected[v] is True if v is in the set.\\n\\nSo the steps are:\\n\\nInitialize selected as all False.\\n\\nsorted_vertices = sorted(range(1, n+1), key=lambda x: len(adj[x]))\\n\\nfor v in sorted_vertices:\\n    if any(selected[u] for u in adj[v]):\\n        continue\\n    else:\\n        selected[v] = True\\n\\nFinally, output all v where selected[v] is True.\\n\\nThis approach should work and is efficient. However, there\\'s a problem here. When processing in sorted order, the check for neighbors includes all neighbors, even those that come later in the sorted list. But those neighbors haven\\'t been processed yet. Wait, no. Because the sorted list is the order in which we process the vertices. So when processing v, any neighbor u that is processed after v (i.e., comes later in the sorted_vertices list) hasn\\'t been considered yet. So when checking selected[u], those u\\'s are still False because they haven\\'t been processed. So the check is only for neighbors that have already been processed (i.e., are in the sorted list before v).\\n\\nWait, no. The sorted_vertices list is in the order of processing. So for a given v in the list, all the vertices that come before v have been processed, and their selected status is known. The vertices after v in the list have not been processed yet, so their selected status is False. So when checking the neighbors of v, the only ones that could possibly be selected are those that are before v in the sorted list. The ones after are not, but since we haven\\'t processed them yet, their selected status is False. Therefore, when processing v, the check for any neighbor in the selected set is equivalent to checking the neighbors that are processed before v.\\n\\nBut this approach may miss some opportunities. For example, if v is processed after u (a neighbor), but u is not selected, then during processing v, even if u is not selected, but u comes before v in the list, then v can be selected. But when u is processed later, but u\\'s neighbors are checked, but in that case, when u is processed, since v was processed earlier (if u comes after v in the list), but that\\'s not possible. So the order matters. Because sorted_vertices is in a fixed order, and processing is done in that order.\\n\\nWait, no. The sorted_vertices list is sorted in the order of increasing degree. So, if u has a lower degree than v, u comes before v. So when processing u first, if u is not selected (because one of its neighbors that comes before u in the list was selected), then when processing v, it can be selected if none of its processed neighbors (those before it in the list) are selected.\\n\\nBut perhaps there\\'s a smarter way. For example, when processing vertices in order of increasing degree, selecting a vertex early (if possible) blocks fewer neighbors. So this could lead to a larger set.\\n\\nAnother variation: process the vertices in a certain order (like random, or some other heuristic), but for each vertex, if none of the already selected vertices are adjacent to it, select it. This is a greedy approach that builds a maximal independent set.\\n\\nThe approach I described earlier (processing in order of increasing degree and selecting a vertex if none of its already selected neighbors have been selected) should result in a maximal independent set. Because once processing is done, you can\\'t add any more vertices to the set without conflicting with existing ones.\\n\\nSo the algorithm is correct in that it produces an independent set. The question is, how to maximize the size of this set.\\n\\nNow, the next step is to implement this in Python, in a way that\\'s efficient for large graphs.\\n\\nBut handling the adjacency list for large n (like 1e5) can be memory-intensive. In Python, for n=1e5, using a list of sets for adjacency is feasible. Because each edge is stored twice (once for each direction), but for m edges, the total storage is 2m.\\n\\nBut for n=1e5 and m=1e6, that\\'s 2e6 entries, which is manageable.\\n\\nNow, reading the input quickly is important. For Python, using sys.stdin.readline is better than input() for speed.\\n\\nSo, steps for code:\\n\\n1. Read n and m from input.\\n2. Read m lines of edges. For each edge (a, b), add b to adj[a] and a to adj[b]. Since vertices are 1-based.\\n3. Compute the degrees for each vertex as the length of their adjacency list.\\n4. Sort the vertices in increasing order of degree. So sorted_vertices = sorted(range(1, n+1), key=lambda x: len(adj[x])).\\n5. Initialize a list selected of size n+1 (indexes 0 to n) with False.\\n6. Iterate over each vertex in sorted_vertices. For each v:\\n   a. Check if any neighbor u in adj[v] has selected[u] is True.\\n   b. If no such neighbor, set selected[v] to True.\\n7. After processing all, collect all v where selected[v] is True. Output the count and the binary list.\\n\\nBut step 6a could be time-consuming for vertices with high degrees. For example, a vertex with 1e5 neighbors would require checking all 1e5 entries. But in practice, if the graph is sparse (like B1-B4, which I don\\'t know the exact structure of), this could be manageable.\\n\\nBut for large m (like 1e6 edges), checking all neighbors for each vertex in sorted order would take O(m) time overall, which is acceptable.\\n\\nBut how to optimize this in Python? Because checking any(selected[u] for u in adj[v]) is O(k) for k being the degree of v.\\n\\nAlternative idea: for each vertex v, when processing, check only the neighbors that have been processed (i.e., are in the sorted list before v). Because any neighbor that comes after v in the sorted list hasn\\'t been processed yet, and their selected status is False. So, in the adjacency list of v, when checking for selected[u], those u that are after v in the sorted list can be skipped. But how to efficiently check this.\\n\\nWait, the sorted list is in a particular order. So for v in the sorted list, all u in adj[v] that are in the sorted list before v can have selected[u] True or False, but those after v in the sorted list are not yet processed, so their selected[u] is False.\\n\\nTherefore, when processing v, we can check all u in adj[v], but only those u that are in the sorted list before v could have selected[u] True. So, in practice, for each u in adj[v], if u is processed before v (i.e., appears before in the sorted_vertices list), then selected[u] might be True. If u is processed after v, then selected[u] is False.\\n\\nTherefore, during the processing of v, checking all u in adj[v] for selected[u] is equivalent to checking all u that are processed before v. Because those processed after v are not in the selected set yet.\\n\\nSo the check is correct.\\n\\nBut in Python, for each u in adj[v], we have to check selected[u], which could be O(1) for each, but for a large degree, it\\'s O(k) per vertex. So, for a graph with m edges, this is O(m) time overall.\\n\\nIn practice, this is manageable.\\n\\nNow, code implementation:\\n\\nRead n and m.\\n\\nThen, read m edges, build adjacency lists.\\n\\nThen, sort the vertices in increasing order of degree.\\n\\nThen, process each vertex in that order.\\n\\nNow, in Python, for speed, using adjacency lists as sets is better for lookups, but in our case, the adjacency lists are for iterating over all neighbors. So a list might be faster than a set, but for building the adjacency, we need to avoid duplicates. However, the problem states that the input doesn\\'t have multiple edges, so each edge is unique. So when building adj, for each a and b, append to each other\\'s list.\\n\\nBut in Python, lists are okay. However, when checking the neighbors, it\\'s a list, and for each u in adj[v], we check selected[u].\\n\\nBut with m edges, each edge is stored twice (once in a\\'s list, once in b\\'s), but in the code, for each edge a-b, we add b to adj[a] and a to adj[b]. So the adjacency lists have 2m entries.\\n\\nBut when processing each vertex, each edge is checked once (once for each direction). So the total time is O(m) for the checks.\\n\\nBut in practice, each edge is checked once for each direction. Wait, no. Because when processing vertex a, we check all its neighbors (including b). Then when processing vertex b, if it\\'s after a in the sorted list, then during processing a, if a is selected, then when processing b, the check for a (selected) would prevent b from being selected. But if a is not selected, then when processing b, the check would look at a\\'s selected status. But a is processed before b, so a\\'s selected status is already determined.\\n\\nSo the code\\'s logic is correct.\\n\\nBut the code will check each edge twice. For example, edge a-b: when processing a, it checks b\\'s selected status (but if b is processed after a, then during a\\'s processing, b is not selected yet. So the check is redundant. Similarly, when processing b, it checks a\\'s selected status (which is already known). But in this case, the code will check all edges in both directions. So the total number of checks is 2m.\\n\\nBut for m=1e6, that\\'s 2e6 checks, each of which is a O(1) lookup. That\\'s manageable in Python within 1 second.\\n\\nSo the code can proceed.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s think about possible optimizations.\\n\\nIn Python, for checking if any neighbor is selected, perhaps using a generator expression and the any() function is efficient. For example, any(selected[u] for u in adj[v]).\\n\\nBut for each vertex v, the adjacency list adj[v] is a list (or set) of its neighbors. Iterating through that list and checking selected[u] for each u is O(k), which is necessary.\\n\\nAnother possible optimization: precompute the order of processing, and for each vertex, only check the neighbors that have been processed before it. But how?\\n\\nBecause the sorted_vertices list is in a fixed order. So, for each vertex v in sorted_vertices, the index in the list is known. For a given u in adj[v], if u is in the sorted_vertices list at a position before v\\'s position, then u has been processed already. So during processing v, we can check only those u that are in the sorted_vertices list before v. But how to check that?\\n\\nBut how to find the position of u in the sorted_vertices list. To do that, we can create a dictionary that maps each vertex to its index in the sorted_vertices list. For example:\\n\\nsorted_vertices = sorted(...)\\npos = {v: idx for idx, v in enumerate(sorted_vertices)}\\n\\nThen, for each u in adj[v], during processing v, we can check if pos[u] < pos[v]. If so, then u has been processed before v, and selected[u] could be True. Otherwise, u is processed after v, so selected[u] is False and can be ignored.\\n\\nThis way, during the check, we can skip the u\\'s that are processed after v.\\n\\nThis could reduce the number of checks. For example, if a vertex v has neighbors that are processed after v, their selected status is False, so we don\\'t need to check them. So, for each v, we only check the neighbors that are in the sorted list before v.\\n\\nThis would reduce the total number of checks from 2m to m (since each edge is checked once: for the vertex with the earlier position in the sorted list).\\n\\nWait, let\\'s see. For edge a-b, if a is processed before b (pos[a] < pos[b]), then during processing a, when checking neighbors, b is not yet processed (so selected[b] is False). So during a\\'s processing, the check for b is skipped. Then, during processing b, since a is processed earlier (pos[a] < pos[b]), we check a\\'s selected status. So for each edge, the check is done once (for the vertex with the higher position in the list). So the total checks would be m instead of 2m.\\n\\nThis could significantly speed up the code for large m.\\n\\nSo the modified algorithm is:\\n\\n- For each vertex v in sorted_vertices order:\\n\\n   for u in adj[v]:\\n      if pos[u] < pos[v]:\\n          if selected[u] is True:\\n              mark v as not selected and break the loop.\\n\\nSo the code would check only the neighbors that are processed before v. This reduces the number of checks.\\n\\nThis seems like a valuable optimization. How to implement this.\\n\\nFirst, create a position dictionary:\\n\\nsorted_vertices = sorted(...)\\npos = {v: i for i, v in enumerate(sorted_vertices)}\\n\\nThen, for each v in sorted_vertices:\\n\\n    if any(selected[u] for u in adj[v] if pos[u] < pos[v]):\\n        continue\\n    else:\\n        selected[v] = True\\n\\nBut how efficient is this in Python? For each u in adj[v], we check if pos[u] < pos[v], which is O(1) with a dictionary. Then, if any of the selected[u] is True for those u\\'s.\\n\\nThis reduces the number of checks from O(2m) to O(m), which is a 2x improvement. This is especially important for large m.\\n\\nSo this is a necessary optimization.\\n\\nTherefore, the steps for code are:\\n\\n1. Read n and m.\\n\\n2. Read m edges and build adjacency lists as a list of sets or lists.\\n\\n3. Sort the vertices in increasing order of degree to get sorted_vertices.\\n\\n4. Create a pos dictionary that maps each vertex to its index in the sorted_vertices list.\\n\\n5. Initialize selected as [False] * (n+1).\\n\\n6. For each v in sorted_vertices:\\n\\n   a. Check if any u in adj[v] where pos[u] < pos[v] and selected[u] is True.\\n\\n   b. If none, set selected[v] = True.\\n\\nThis way, during the check for v, we only consider neighbors u that are processed before v. The ones processed after are not checked, as their selected[u] is False.\\n\\nThis reduces the number of checks.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s think about implementing this in Python.\\n\\nBut for large n (like 1e5), building the pos dictionary with a loop is O(n), which is acceptable.\\n\\nSo code:\\n\\nimport sys\\n\\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\\nadj = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\\nfor _ in range(m):\\n    a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\\n    adj[a].append(b)\\n    adj[b].append(a)\\n\\nsorted_vertices = sorted(range(1, n+1), key=lambda x: len(adj[x]))\\npos = {v: i for i, v in enumerate(sorted_vertices)}\\n\\nselected = [False] * (n+1)\\n\\nfor v in sorted_vertices:\\n    conflict = False\\n    for u in adj[v]:\\n        if pos[u] < pos[v] and selected[u]:\\n            conflict = True\\n            break\\n    if not conflict:\\n        selected[v] = True\\n\\ncount = sum(selected)\\nprint(count)\\nprint(\\' \\'.join(map(str, [int(selected[i]) for i in range(1, n+1)])))\\n\\nBut wait, in the code above, adj is a list of lists, not sets. So for each edge, it\\'s stored twice. For example, a and b each have each other in their adjacency lists.\\n\\nBut the code reads the edges correctly.\\n\\nNow, in the code, sorted_vertices is ordered by len(adj[x]), which is the initial degree of the vertex. But after vertices are removed (marked as selected or not), the degrees of the remaining vertices could change. However, this approach uses the initial degrees, not the dynamic ones. So this is a heuristic based on the original graph.\\n\\nBut this heuristic is the same as the greedy minimal degree algorithm, except that it\\'s based on initial degrees, not the current degrees. But in practice, this could still yield a good result.\\n\\nAnother point: the order is fixed once sorted_vertices is computed, regardless of any changes in the graph. So this is a static ordering.\\n\\nBut how does this compare to the dynamic approach where after selecting a vertex, the degrees of remaining vertices are updated? The dynamic approach is more accurate but computationally expensive.\\n\\nFor large graphs, the dynamic approach may not be feasible. So the static ordering is a trade-off between time and solution quality.\\n\\nIn the code above, we\\'re using the static ordering. But this could lead to a good approximation.\\n\\nAnother possible optimization: process the vertices in the order of increasing current degree. But as the degrees change when vertices are selected, this is not feasible unless we have a way to track degrees efficiently.\\n\\nBut that\\'s probably not possible in Python for large n and m within the time constraints.\\n\\nTherefore, the code as written is a feasible solution that can handle large graphs and provides a good approximation.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s test the code with a small example.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\nn=3, m=2\\n\\nEdges: 1-2, 2-3.\\n\\nThe degrees are:\\n\\n1: 1\\n\\n2: 2\\n\\n3: 1\\n\\nsorted_vertices would be [1,3,2], because their degrees are 1,1,2.\\n\\nProcessing order: 1,3,2.\\n\\nProcessing 1: check neighbors (2). Since 2 is in the sorted list after 1, pos[2] is 2 which is greater than pos[1] (0). So no neighbor processed before. So select 1. selected[1] = True.\\n\\nProcessing 3: check neighbors (2). 2\\'s pos is 2, which is greater than pos[3] (1). So no neighbor processed before. So select 3. selected[3] = True.\\n\\nProcessing 2: check neighbors (1 and 3). Both 1 and 3 are processed before (pos 0 and 1). selected[1] and selected[3] are True. So conflict exists. So 2 is not selected.\\n\\nThe independent set is {1,3}, size 2. Which is correct.\\n\\nAnother example:\\n\\nn=4, m=4\\n\\nEdges: 1-2, 1-3, 2-3, 3-4.\\n\\nDegrees:\\n\\n1: 2\\n\\n2: 2\\n\\n3: 3\\n\\n4: 1\\n\\nsorted_vertices order: 4 (degree 1), 1 (2), 2 (2), 3 (3).\\n\\nProcessing 4: check neighbors (3). 3 is in the sorted list after 4 (pos 3). So no conflict. selected[4] = True.\\n\\nProcessing 1: check neighbors (2 and 3). 2 and 3 are processed after 1 (positions 2 and 3). So no conflict. selected[1] = True.\\n\\nProcessing 2: check neighbors (1,3). 1 is processed before (pos 1). selected[1] is True. Conflict. So 2 is not selected.\\n\\nProcessing 3: check neighbors (1,2,4). 1 and 2 are processed before. selected[1] is True. So conflict. Not selected.\\n\\nSo the independent set is {4,1}, size 2. But in this graph, there\\'s a larger independent set: {1,4} is size 2. But perhaps there\\'s a better one. Wait, in this graph, another possible set is {2,4} which is also size 2. Or {3} which is size 1. Wait, no. The maximum independent set here is 2. So the code\\'s output is correct.\\n\\nBut in another scenario, perhaps a different order would yield a larger set. But this depends on the heuristic.\\n\\nIn any case, the code produces a valid maximal independent set.\\n\\nThus, the code should work correctly and efficiently.\\n</think>\\n\\n```python\\nimport sys\\n\\ndef main():\\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\\n    for _ in range(m):\\n        a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\\n        adj[a].append(b)\\n        adj[b].append(a)\\n    \\n    # Sort vertices by their initial degree (ascending)\\n    sorted_vertices = sorted(range(1, n+1), key=lambda x: len(adj[x]))\\n    pos = {v: idx for idx, v in enumerate(sorted_vertices)}\\n    \\n    selected = [False] * (n + 1)\\n    \\n    for v in sorted_vertices:\\n        conflict = False\\n        # Check only neighbors processed before v\\n        for u in adj[v]:\\n            if pos[u] < pos[v] and selected[u]:\\n                conflict = True\\n                break\\n        if not conflict:\\n            selected[v] = True\\n    \\n    count = sum(selected)\\n    print(count)\\n    print(\\' \\'.join(\\'1\\' if selected[i] else \\'0\\' for i in range(1, n+1)))\\n\\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\\n    main()\\n```', 'role': 'assistant'}]], 'verification_result': [{'expected': ['6 7', '14 21', '2 4', '-1 -1'], 'got': ['1 2', '13 26', '2 4', '-1 -1'], 'input': '4\\n1 1337\\n13 69\\n2 4\\n88 89', 'passed_all': False, 'reason': 'Wrong Answer on test 1', 'stderr': None}, {'expected': None, 'got': None, 'input': None, 'passed_all': False, 'reason': \"No test cases found in 'examples' field.\", 'stderr': None}, {'expected': ['0', '2 1 4'], 'got': ['0', '2 4 1'], 'input': '4', 'passed_all': False, 'reason': 'Wrong Answer on test 1', 'stderr': None}, {'expected': None, 'got': None, 'input': None, 'passed_all': False, 'reason': \"No test cases found in 'examples' field.\", 'stderr': None}]}\n"

Since the problem says it's okay not to be optimal but to get as many points as possible, I need an efficient heuristic approach that works well for large graphs.</p>\n",

       "<p>The classic approach for finding a maximal independent set (not maximum) is a greedy algorithm. But which greedy strategy? There are a few possibilities. One common method is to process the vertices in some order (like descending order of degree) and select a vertex if none of its neighbors have been selected yet. Alternatively, there's the approach of repeatedly picking the vertex with the smallest degree, adding it to the set, and removing its neighbors. But maybe there's a better heuristic here.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, another idea: for each vertex, if it's not adjacent to any selected vertices, add it to the set. But the order in which we process the vertices matters.

Alternatively, maybe processing low-degree vertices first allows more vertices to be added. Hmm.</p>\n",
       "<p>I remember reading that for the maximum independent set problem, which is NP-hard, greedy algorithms can give good approximations.

This is called the greedy minimal degree algorithm. This might be a good approach here.</p>\n",
       "<p>Let me think: when you select a vertex of minimal degree, you eliminate that vertex and its neighbors.

       "</ul>\n",
       "<p>But how to efficiently track the degrees of active vertices as neighbors are removed?</p>\n",
       "<p>Storing the adjacency lists and a list of active vertices, along with current degrees. But when a vertex is removed (as part of adding to the set or being a neighbor), we need to update the degrees of their neighbors. However, this can be expensive if done naively for large graphs.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, since once a vertex is removed (either added to the set or as a neighbor), it's no longer considered. So perhaps we can process the vertices in order of their initial degrees, but that's static and might not account for the dynamic changes as vertices are removed. Alternatively, we can recompute the degrees of remaining vertices each time, but that would be O(n) each iteration, leading to O(n^2) time, which is not feasible for large n.</p>\n",
       "<p>Hmm. So for very large graphs, this approach might not be feasible. Let's think about the time constraints. For example, a graph with 1e5 vertices and 1e6 edges. The algorithm must run in O(m + n) or O(n log n) time.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another approach: use a heuristic that processes the vertices in some order and greedily selects each vertex if none of its neighbors have been selected yet. For example, process the vertices in order of increasing degree. But how to implement this efficiently.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, a simple linear pass through the vertices in a certain order, adding the vertex to the set only if none of its already processed neighbors are in the set. This is a standard greedy approach and runs in O(n + m) time. But the order of processing can significantly affect the result. For example, processing in order of increasing degree (lowest first) might yield a larger set, as choosing a vertex with low degree early on doesn't block too many others.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the algorithm steps would be:</p>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Sort all vertices in increasing order of degree.</li>\n",
       "<li>Iterate through the sorted list, and for each vertex, add it to the set if none of its neighbors (who have already been processed) are in the set.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but in this approach, since we process vertices in a certain order, when considering a vertex, we check if any of its neighbors that have already been processed (and thus are in the set) would conflict. If none are in the set, we add the current vertex. Since we process in order, once a vertex is added, its neighbors (processed later) won't be added.</p>\n",
       "<p>But this depends on the order. For example, if you process in reverse order (high degree first), adding a high-degree vertex would prevent all its neighbors from being added. But in the case of low-degree first, adding a low-degree vertex blocks fewer neighbors. So this might lead to a larger set.</p>\n",
       "<p>So implementing this approach would involve:</p>\n",
       "<ol>\n",
       "<li>Preprocessing the degrees of each vertex.</li>\n",
       "<li>Sorting the vertices in order of increasing degree.</li>\n",
       "<li>Iterating through this sorted list, and for each vertex, check if any of its neighbors that have already been considered (processed earlier) are in the set. If not, add it to the set.</li>\n",
       "</ol>\n",
       "<p>But how to efficiently check if any neighbor in the set? Because for each vertex, you have to check all its neighbors, but since you process the vertices in order, the neighbors that are processed after the current vertex are not in the set yet. So when checking, you only need to look at neighbors that have been processed before the current vertex. Wait, no. Because the neighbors could be processed either before or after. For example, if vertex A is processed before vertex B, and A and B are connected. If A is not added to the set, then B can be added. But if A is added, B cannot. So during the processing of B, you check whether any of its neighbors that are already processed (i.e., those with index less than B in the sorted list) have been added to the set.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but how to track that. Let's think: the vertices are sorted in some order, say S. For each vertex v in S, we process them one by one. For each v, when considering adding to the set, we check if any of its neighbors that are already in the set. The set is built incrementally. So during processing v, the only neighbors that could be in the set are those that come before v in S and have been processed and added. Because neighbors that come after v in S haven't been processed yet, so they can't be in the set.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, for each vertex v in the sorted list, when processing it, check all its neighbors. If any neighbor u has been added to the set (i.e., u is in the set and was processed before v), then v cannot be added. Otherwise, add v to the set.</p>\n",
       "<p>But this requires, for each v, to check all its neighbors. For large graphs, this could be O(m) time. Which is acceptable if m is up to 1e6 or even 1e7. For example, 1e6 edges would take 1e6 operations, which is manageable in Python within 1 second.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the steps are:</p>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Read the graph, compute degrees for each vertex.</li>\n",
       "<li>Sort the vertices in increasing order of degree (so low-degree first).</li>\n",
       "<li>For each vertex in this order:</li>\n",
       "<li>Check if any of its neighbors have already been added to the independent set.</li>\n",
       "<li>If none are present, add this vertex to the set.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<p>This approach is O(m) time (for checking neighbors) plus O(n log n) for sorting. Which should be acceptable for n up to 1e5.</p>\n",
       "<p>But wait, when a vertex is processed, we check all its neighbors. For example, a vertex with degree 1000 would require checking 1000 neighbors. For a graph with m edges, this is O(m) in total. So overall, the algorithm is O(n log n + m) time, which is manageable.</p>\n",
       "<p>This seems like a feasible approach. Let's think about how to implement this.</p>\n",
       "<p>In Python, we can represent the adjacency list as a list of sets. For each vertex v, adj[v] is a set of its neighbors.</p>\n",
       "<p>We first compute the degrees. Then, sort the vertices in increasing order of their degree. Then, iterate through each vertex in this order. For each, check if any of its neighbors are already in the set. To track which vertices are in the set, we can use a boolean array (selected) where selected[v] is True if v is in the set.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the steps are:</p>\n",
       "<p>Initialize selected as all False.</p>\n",
       "<p>sorted_vertices = sorted(range(1, n+1), key=lambda x: len(adj[x]))</p>\n",
       "<p>for v in sorted_vertices:\n",
       "    if any(selected[u] for u in adj[v]):\n",
       "        continue\n",
       "    else:\n",
       "        selected[v] = True</p>\n",
       "<p>Finally, output all v where selected[v] is True.</p>\n",
       "<p>This approach should work and is efficient. However, there's a problem here. When processing in sorted order, the check for neighbors includes all neighbors, even those that come later in the sorted list. But those neighbors haven't been processed yet. Wait, no. Because the sorted list is the order in which we process the vertices. So when processing v, any neighbor u that is processed after v (i.e., comes later in the sorted_vertices list) hasn't been considered yet. So when checking selected[u], those u's are still False because they haven't been processed. So the check is only for neighbors that have already been processed (i.e., are in the sorted list before v).</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, no. The sorted_vertices list is in the order of processing. So for a given v in the list, all the vertices that come before v have been processed, and their selected status is known. The vertices after v in the list have not been processed yet, so their selected status is False. So when checking the neighbors of v, the only ones that could possibly be selected are those that are before v in the sorted list. The ones after are not, but since we haven't processed them yet, their selected status is False. Therefore, when processing v, the check for any neighbor in the selected set is equivalent to checking the neighbors that are processed before v.</p>\n",
       "<p>But this approach may miss some opportunities. For example, if v is processed after u (a neighbor), but u is not selected, then during processing v, even if u is not selected, but u comes before v in the list, then v can be selected. But when u is processed later, but u's neighbors are checked, but in that case, when u is processed, since v was processed earlier (if u comes after v in the list), but that's not possible. So the order matters. Because sorted_vertices is in a fixed order, and processing is done in that order.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, no. The sorted_vertices list is sorted in the order of increasing degree. So, if u has a lower degree than v, u comes before v. So when processing u first, if u is not selected (because one of its neighbors that comes before u in the list was selected), then when processing v, it can be selected if none of its processed neighbors (those before it in the list) are selected.</p>\n",
       "<p>But perhaps there's a smarter way. For example, when processing vertices in order of increasing degree, selecting a vertex early (if possible) blocks fewer neighbors. So this could lead to a larger set.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another variation: process the vertices in a certain order (like random, or some other heuristic), but for each vertex, if none of the already selected vertices are adjacent to it, select it. This is a greedy approach that builds a maximal independent set.</p>\n",
       "<p>The approach I described earlier (processing in order of increasing degree and selecting a vertex if none of its already selected neighbors have been selected) should result in a maximal independent set. Because once processing is done, you can't add any more vertices to the set without conflicting with existing ones.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the algorithm is correct in that it produces an independent set. The question is, how to maximize the size of this set.</p>\n",
       "<p>Now, the next step is to implement this in Python, in a way that's efficient for large graphs.</p>\n",
       "<p>But handling the adjacency list for large n (like 1e5) can be memory-intensive. In Python, for n=1e5, using a list of sets for adjacency is feasible. Because each edge is stored twice (once for each direction), but for m edges, the total storage is 2m.</p>\n",
       "<p>But for n=1e5 and m=1e6, that's 2e6 entries, which is manageable.</p>\n",
       "<p>Now, reading the input quickly is important. For Python, using sys.stdin.readline is better than input() for speed.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, steps for code:</p>\n",
       "<ol>\n",
       "<li>Read n and m from input.</li>\n",
       "<li>Read m lines of edges. For each edge (a, b), add b to adj[a] and a to adj[b]. Since vertices are 1-based.</li>\n",
       "<li>Compute the degrees for each vertex as the length of their adjacency list.</li>\n",
       "<li>Sort the vertices in increasing order of degree. So sorted_vertices = sorted(range(1, n+1), key=lambda x: len(adj[x])).</li>\n",
       "<li>Initialize a list selected of size n+1 (indexes 0 to n) with False.</li>\n",
       "<li>Iterate over each vertex in sorted_vertices. For each v:\n",
       "   a. Check if any neighbor u in adj[v] has selected[u] is True.\n",
       "   b. If no such neighbor, set selected[v] to True.</li>\n",
       "<li>After processing all, collect all v where selected[v] is True. Output the count and the binary list.</li>\n",
       "</ol>\n",
       "<p>But step 6a could be time-consuming for vertices with high degrees. For example, a vertex with 1e5 neighbors would require checking all 1e5 entries. But in practice, if the graph is sparse (like B1-B4, which I don't know the exact structure of), this could be manageable.</p>\n",
       "<p>But for large m (like 1e6 edges), checking all neighbors for each vertex in sorted order would take O(m) time overall, which is acceptable.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to optimize this in Python? Because checking any(selected[u] for u in adj[v]) is O(k) for k being the degree of v.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternative idea: for each vertex v, when processing, check only the neighbors that have been processed (i.e., are in the sorted list before v). Because any neighbor that comes after v in the sorted list hasn't been processed yet, and their selected status is False. So, in the adjacency list of v, when checking for selected[u], those u that are after v in the sorted list can be skipped. But how to efficiently check this.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, the sorted list is in a particular order. So for v in the sorted list, all u in adj[v] that are in the sorted list before v can have selected[u] True or False, but those after v in the sorted list are not yet processed, so their selected[u] is False.</p>\n",
       "<p>Therefore, when processing v, we can check all u in adj[v], but only those u that are in the sorted list before v could have selected[u] True. So, in practice, for each u in adj[v], if u is processed before v (i.e., appears before in the sorted_vertices list), then selected[u] might be True. If u is processed after v, then selected[u] is False.</p>\n",
       "<p>Therefore, during the processing of v, checking all u in adj[v] for selected[u] is equivalent to checking all u that are processed before v. Because those processed after v are not in the selected set yet.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the check is correct.</p>\n",
       "<p>But in Python, for each u in adj[v], we have to check selected[u], which could be O(1) for each, but for a large degree, it's O(k) per vertex. So, for a graph with m edges, this is O(m) time overall.</p>\n",
       "<p>In practice, this is manageable.</p>\n",
       "<p>Now, code implementation:</p>\n",
       "<p>Read n and m.</p>\n",
       "<p>Then, read m edges, build adjacency lists.</p>\n",
       "<p>Then, sort the vertices in increasing order of degree.</p>\n",
       "<p>Then, process each vertex in that order.</p>\n",
       "<p>Now, in Python, for speed, using adjacency lists as sets is better for lookups, but in our case, the adjacency lists are for iterating over all neighbors. So a list might be faster than a set, but for building the adjacency, we need to avoid duplicates. However, the problem states that the input doesn't have multiple edges, so each edge is unique. So when building adj, for each a and b, append to each other's list.</p>\n",
       "<p>But in Python, lists are okay. However, when checking the neighbors, it's a list, and for each u in adj[v], we check selected[u].</p>\n",
       "<p>But with m edges, each edge is stored twice (once in a's list, once in b's), but in the code, for each edge a-b, we add b to adj[a] and a to adj[b]. So the adjacency lists have 2m entries.</p>\n",
       "<p>But when processing each vertex, each edge is checked once (once for each direction). So the total time is O(m) for the checks.</p>\n",
       "<p>But in practice, each edge is checked once for each direction. Wait, no. Because when processing vertex a, we check all its neighbors (including b). Then when processing vertex b, if it's after a in the sorted list, then during processing a, if a is selected, then when processing b, the check for a (selected) would prevent b from being selected. But if a is not selected, then when processing b, the check would look at a's selected status. But a is processed before b, so a's selected status is already determined.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the code's logic is correct.</p>\n",
       "<p>But the code will check each edge twice. For example, edge a-b: when processing a, it checks b's selected status (but if b is processed after a, then during a's processing, b is not selected yet. So the check is redundant. Similarly, when processing b, it checks a's selected status (which is already known). But in this case, the code will check all edges in both directions. So the total number of checks is 2m.</p>\n",
       "<p>But for m=1e6, that's 2e6 checks, each of which is a O(1) lookup. That's manageable in Python within 1 second.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the code can proceed.</p>\n",
       "<p>Now, let's think about possible optimizations.</p>\n",
       "<p>In Python, for checking if any neighbor is selected, perhaps using a generator expression and the any() function is efficient. For example, any(selected[u] for u in adj[v]).</p>\n",
       "<p>But for each vertex v, the adjacency list adj[v] is a list (or set) of its neighbors. Iterating through that list and checking selected[u] for each u is O(k), which is necessary.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another possible optimization: precompute the order of processing, and for each vertex, only check the neighbors that have been processed before it. But how?</p>\n",
       "<p>Because the sorted_vertices list is in a fixed order. So, for each vertex v in sorted_vertices, the index in the list is known. For a given u in adj[v], if u is in the sorted_vertices list at a position before v's position, then u has been processed already. So during processing v, we can check only those u that are in the sorted_vertices list before v. But how to check that?</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to find the position of u in the sorted_vertices list. To do that, we can create a dictionary that maps each vertex to its index in the sorted_vertices list. For example:</p>\n",
       "<p>sorted_vertices = sorted(...)\n",
       "pos = {v: idx for idx, v in enumerate(sorted_vertices)}</p>\n",
       "<p>Then, for each u in adj[v], during processing v, we can check if pos[u] &lt; pos[v]. If so, then u has been processed before v, and selected[u] could be True. Otherwise, u is processed after v, so selected[u] is False and can be ignored.</p>\n",
       "<p>This way, during the check, we can skip the u's that are processed after v.</p>\n",
       "<p>This could reduce the number of checks. For example, if a vertex v has neighbors that are processed after v, their selected status is False, so we don't need to check them. So, for each v, we only check the neighbors that are in the sorted list before v.</p>\n",
       "<p>This would reduce the total number of checks from 2m to m (since each edge is checked once: for the vertex with the earlier position in the sorted list).</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, let's see. For edge a-b, if a is processed before b (pos[a] &lt; pos[b]), then during processing a, when checking neighbors, b is not yet processed (so selected[b] is False). So during a's processing, the check for b is skipped. Then, during processing b, since a is processed earlier (pos[a] &lt; pos[b]), we check a's selected status. So for each edge, the check is done once (for the vertex with the higher position in the list). So the total checks would be m instead of 2m.</p>\n",
       "<p>This could significantly speed up the code for large m.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the modified algorithm is:</p>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>For each vertex v in sorted_vertices order:</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<p>for u in adj[v]:\n",
       "      if pos[u] &lt; pos[v]:\n",

       "              mark v as not selected and break the loop.</p>\n",

       "<p>But the code reads the edges correctly.</p>\n",
       "<p>Now, in the code, sorted_vertices is ordered by len(adj[x]), which is the initial degree of the vertex. But after vertices are removed (marked as selected or not), the degrees of the remaining vertices could change. However, this approach uses the initial degrees, not the dynamic ones. So this is a heuristic based on the original graph.</p>\n",
       "<p>But this heuristic is the same as the greedy minimal degree algorithm, except that it's based on initial degrees, not the current degrees. But in practice, this could still yield a good result.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another point: the order is fixed once sorted_vertices is computed, regardless of any changes in the graph. So this is a static ordering.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how does this compare to the dynamic approach where after selecting a vertex, the degrees of remaining vertices are updated? The dynamic approach is more accurate but computationally expensive.</p>\n",
       "<p>For large graphs, the dynamic approach may not be feasible. So the static ordering is a trade-off between time and solution quality.</p>\n",
       "<p>In the code above, we're using the static ordering. But this could lead to a good approximation.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another possible optimization: process the vertices in the order of increasing current degree. But as the degrees change when vertices are selected, this is not feasible unless we have a way to track degrees efficiently.</p>\n",
       "<p>But that's probably not possible in Python for large n and m within the time constraints.</p>\n",
       "<p>Therefore, the code as written is a feasible solution that can handle large graphs and provides a good approximation.</p>\n",
       "<p>Now, let's test the code with a small example.</p>\n",
       "<p>Example:</p>\n",
       "<p>n=3, m=2</p>\n",
       "<p>Edges: 1-2, 2-3.</p>\n",
       "<p>The degrees are:</p>\n",
       "<p>1: 1</p>\n",
       "<p>2: 2</p>\n",
       "<p>3: 1</p>\n",
       "<p>sorted_vertices would be [1,3,2], because their degrees are 1,1,2.</p>\n",
       "<p>Processing order: 1,3,2.</p>\n",
       "<p>Processing 1: check neighbors (2). Since 2 is in the sorted list after 1, pos[2] is 2 which is greater than pos[1] (0). So no neighbor processed before. So select 1. selected[1] = True.</p>\n",
       "<p>Processing 3: check neighbors (2). 2's pos is 2, which is greater than pos[3] (1). So no neighbor processed before. So select 3. selected[3] = True.</p>\n",
       "<p>Processing 2: check neighbors (1 and 3). Both 1 and 3 are processed before (pos 0 and 1). selected[1] and selected[3] are True. So conflict exists. So 2 is not selected.</p>\n",
       "<p>The independent set is {1,3}, size 2. Which is correct.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another example:</p>\n",
       "<p>n=4, m=4</p>\n",
       "<p>Edges: 1-2, 1-3, 2-3, 3-4.</p>\n",
       "<p>Degrees:</p>\n",
       "<p>1: 2</p>\n",
       "<p>2: 2</p>\n",
       "<p>3: 3</p>\n",
       "<p>4: 1</p>\n",
       "<p>sorted_vertices order: 4 (degree 1), 1 (2), 2 (2), 3 (3).</p>\n",
       "<p>Processing 4: check neighbors (3). 3 is in the sorted list after 4 (pos 3). So no conflict. selected[4] = True.</p>\n",
       "<p>Processing 1: check neighbors (2 and 3). 2 and 3 are processed after 1 (positions 2 and 3). So no conflict. selected[1] = True.</p>\n",
       "<p>Processing 2: check neighbors (1,3). 1 is processed before (pos 1). selected[1] is True. Conflict. So 2 is not selected.</p>\n",
       "<p>Processing 3: check neighbors (1,2,4). 1 and 2 are processed before. selected[1] is True. So conflict. Not selected.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the independent set is {4,1}, size 2. But in this graph, there's a larger independent set: {1,4} is size 2. But perhaps there's a better one. Wait, in this graph, another possible set is {2,4} which is also size 2. Or {3} which is size 1. Wait, no. The maximum independent set here is 2. So the code's output is correct.</p>\n",
       "<p>But in another scenario, perhaps a different order would yield a larger set. But this depends on the heuristic.</p>\n",
       "<p>In any case, the code produces a valid maximal independent set.</p>\n",
       "<p>Thus, the code should work correctly and efficiently.\n",

       "Okay, let's see. We need to find two integers x and y such that l ≤ x &lt; y ≤ r, and their LCM is between l and r inclusive. If not possible, output -1 -1.</p>\n",
       "<p>First, the problem examples give some clues. For instance, in the third test case (2 4), the answer is 2 and 4. Their LCM is 4, which is within the range. So in that case, choosing consecutive even numbers might be a good idea.</p>\n",
       "<p>Hmm. Let's think about when it's possible. The key is to find x and y where LCM(x,y) is ≤ r. Because if x and y are both ≤ r, then their LCM must be ≤ r * (y-1) or something, but that's not helpful. Wait, wait. The LCM of x and y is the smallest number divisible by both. So LCM(x,y) is at least max(x,y), since the maximum of x and y is already a multiple of itself. But since y &gt; x (since x &lt; y), then LCM(x,y) ≥ y. But since y ≤ r, the LCM must be ≥ y. So the LCM needs to be between l and r. But wait, the LCM is at least y, which is at least x+1 (since x &lt; y). So for the LCM to be ≤ r, we need y ≤ r. But y is already ≤ r. So the real constraint is that LCM(x,y) ≤ r.</p>\n",
       "<p>So how can we find x and y such that their LCM is ≤ r? The minimal possible LCM is when x and y are such that one divides the other. For example, if y is a multiple of x. Then LCM(x,y) = y. So in this case, if y is ≤ r, then the LCM is exactly y. So if we can find such a pair where y is between l and r, then the LCM is y, which is within the required range.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the strategy could be: look for two consecutive even numbers, or a number and its double, but perhaps the simplest approach is to check if there exists a pair where one is a multiple of the other. For example, x and y where y is 2x. But perhaps even simpler: check if there is a pair x and 2x where 2x is ≤ r. If that's possible, then LCM(x, 2x) is 2x, which is ≤ r. So if l ≤ x &lt; 2x ≤ r, then x and 2x would be a valid pair.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but how to find x such that 2x is ≤ r and x ≥ l. So x can be as low as l, but 2x has to be ≤ r. So the maximum x in this case is r//2. So if l &lt;= r//2, then x can be l, and y = 2<em>l. Then LCM is 2</em>l. And we need to check if this LCM is &gt;= l (which it is) and &lt;= r. So as long as 2<em>l &lt;= r, then x = l and y = 2</em>l would work. Because LCM(l, 2l) = 2l. So for example, if the input is 2 4, then 2*2=4 &lt;=4, so LCM is 4 which is within 2 and 4.</p>\n",
       "<p>So in this case, if 2<em>l &lt;= r, then the answer is l and 2</em>l. Because x &lt; y (since l &lt; 2l when l is at least 1), and LCM is 2l which is &lt;=r.</p>\n",
       "<p>But wait, in the third test case of the example (2 4), 2<em>2=4, which is equal to r. So that's acceptable. So if 2</em>l &lt;= r, then output l and 2*l.</p>\n",
       "<p>But what if l is such that 2<em>l &gt; r? Then that approach wouldn't work. For example, in the case where l is 3 and r is 5. Then 2</em>3=6&gt;5, so we can't do that. So in that case, we need another approach.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, if there's any even number between l and r. For example, if there are two consecutive numbers where one is even. Let's think: take x and x+1. Their LCM is x*(x+1) if they are coprime, but that's probably larger than r. So that's not useful unless x and x+1 are small. But for larger l and r, x and x+1 would be large, making their LCM possibly exceed r.</p>\n",
       "<p>Hmm. So perhaps the best approach is to check if there's a pair where one is a multiple of the other. If that exists, then return that pair. Otherwise, check other possibilities.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to check this efficiently.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another approach: if there exists any x in [l, r] such that 2x &lt;= r. Then x and 2x is a valid pair. So the minimal x is l, and 2x must be &lt;=r. So if l*2 &lt;=r, then the answer is l and 2l.</p>\n",
       "<p>So in the first example input:</p>\n",
       "<p>Test case 1: l=1, r=1337. Then 1*2=2 &lt;=1337. So the answer is 1 and 2. But the sample output is 6 and 7. Wait, that's conflicting. Oh, wait. Wait, no. The sample output for the first test case is 6 7. Hmm. But according to this logic, why isn't 1 and 2 the answer? Because their LCM is 2, which is between 1 and 1337. So why isn't that the case?</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, the problem requires that x and y satisfy l ≤ x &lt; y ≤r, and LCM(x,y) is between l and r. But the LCM in this case (1,2) is 2, which is between 1 and 1337. So why isn't that the answer? The sample output for the first test case is 6 7. But according to this approach, there's a valid pair. So perhaps the sample is wrong. Wait, no. Let me check the sample input again.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait the sample input for the first test case is 1 and 1337. The output is 6 7. So LCM(6,7) is 42, which is between 1 and 1337. So that's a valid pair. But according to the logic of x and 2x, 1 and 2 is also a valid pair. So why isn't that the answer? Because the problem allows any valid pair, but the code can output any of them. So the sample output is just one possible solution.</p>\n",
       "<p>But in that case, why does the sample output not choose the minimal x and y? Because perhaps the code's approach was to pick x and x+1 when possible. But in any case, the problem allows any valid pair.</p>\n",
       "<p>So perhaps the initial approach of checking if 2*l &lt;= r is the way to go. Because that would give a valid pair.</p>\n",
       "<p>So for any test case where 2<em>l &lt;= r, the answer would be l and 2</em>l.</p>\n",
       "<p>But wait, the first sample input's l is 1, 2*l is 2. So the pair (1,2) would have LCM 2. Which is valid. So why isn't that the answer in the sample output? Because the sample output is 6 7, which is another valid pair. But the problem states that any valid pair is acceptable.</p>\n",
       "<p>So perhaps the sample is just showing another possible solution. So the code can output any pair as long as it's valid.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the key insight is that if 2<em>l &lt;= r, then the pair (l, 2</em>l) is valid. So that's a very quick check, and can be done in O(1) per test case. But what about cases where 2<em>l &gt; r? For example, the third sample input is 2 4. 2</em>2=4 is equal to r, so the pair (2,4) is valid.</p>\n",
       "<p>But in the case where l is 3 and r is 5: 3*2=6&gt;5. So we can't do that. So we need to find another pair.</p>\n",
       "<p>In such cases, perhaps we can look for consecutive even numbers, like 3 and 4. LCM(3,4) is 12, which is larger than 5. So that's no good.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, perhaps the pair (3,5). LCM(15) which is 15, which is larger than 5. No.</p>\n",
       "<p>Hmm. So in this case, the answer is impossible. So how to handle cases where 2*l &gt; r.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another example: l=88, r=89 (the last test case in the sample). So possible pairs are 88 and 89. LCM is 88*89 = 7832, which is way bigger than r (89). So no pair exists. So output -1 -1.</p>\n",
       "<p>So what's the condition when there's no solution?</p>\n",
       "<p>If for all pairs x &lt; y in [l, r], the LCM(x,y) is &gt; r. So when is that possible?</p>\n",
       "<p>The LCM of x and y is at least y (since y is a multiple of x's divisor). So the minimal possible LCM is y. So for the LCM to be &lt;= r, y must be &lt;= r, which it already is. But LCM is y only if x divides y. So if there's no pair x &lt; y where x divides y, then the LCM of x and y will be at least the minimal multiple that's divisible by both, which could be greater than r.</p>\n",
       "<p>So how to find such a pair when 2*l &gt; r.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but if 2*l &gt; r, then l and r are consecutive numbers. For example, l=3, r=5. Then possible pairs are (3,4), (3,5), (4,5).</p>\n",
       "<p>Their LCMs are:</p>\n",
       "<p>3 and4:12&gt;5.</p>\n",
       "<p>3 and5:15&gt;5.</p>\n",
       "<p>4 and5:20&gt;5.</p>\n",
       "<p>So output is -1 -1.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to find a valid pair when possible.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another example: l=5, r=6.</p>\n",
       "<p>Possible pairs: (5,6). LCM is 30&gt;6. So output is -1-1.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another example: l=4, r=5. Pair (4,5) LCM is 20&gt;5. No solution.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but what if the pair is (4,5). LCM is 20&gt;5. So no.</p>\n",
       "<p>Hmm.</p>\n",
       "<p>So when 2<em>l &gt; r, the only possible pairs are consecutive numbers. But their LCM is x</em>(x+1) if they are coprime, which would be larger than r.</p>\n",
       "<p>So in such cases, the only possible way to have LCM(x,y) &lt;= r is if y is a multiple of x, but since x &gt;= l, and y =x <em>k. But since 2x &gt; r, then x must be larger than r/2. So y would be x </em>2, but x is at least r/2 +1 (since x &gt;= l and l &gt; r/2). So x*2 would be larger than r. So there's no possible multiple.</p>\n",
       "<p>So in this case, the answer is impossible.</p>\n",
       "<p>Thus, the conclusion is: if 2<em>l &lt;= r, then there exists a pair (l, 2</em>l) which is valid. Otherwise, check if there's any pair where one is a multiple of the other. But if 2<em>l &gt; r, then even the minimal possible multiple (x</em>2) would be larger than r, so no possible pairs. Hence, in such cases, the answer is -1-1.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but wait. What if l=3, r=6. Then 2*3=6 &lt;=6. So the pair (3,6) has LCM 6 which is between 3 and 6. So output 3 6.</p>\n",
       "<p>Yes. So the condition is if 2<em>l &lt;= r, then output l and 2</em>l. Otherwise, check if there exists any pair x, y where y is a multiple of x. But when 2<em>l &gt; r, it's possible that l is 5 and r is 10. Then 2</em>5=10, which is &lt;=10. So the pair (5,10) is valid.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but in that case, 2<em>l is 10, which equals r. So the condition 2</em>l &lt;= r is satisfied. So the code would output 5 and 10.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the initial approach of checking 2*l &lt;= r seems sufficient.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the algorithm could be:</p>\n",
       "<p>For each test case:</p>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>if 2<em>l &lt;= r: output l and 2</em>l.</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>else: check if there exists any x and y in [l, r] where x &lt; y and LCM(x,y) &lt;= r.</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<p>But when 2*l &gt; r, then the possible x and y must be such that y is a multiple of x and y &lt;= r.</p>\n",
       "<p>But since x &gt;= l, and y is a multiple of x (&gt;= x<em>2), but x</em>2 &gt;= 2<em>l. But 2</em>l &gt; r, so x*2 &gt; r. Hence, y can't be a multiple of x. So in such cases, there are no possible pairs. Hence, output -1-1.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but wait. Let's take l=3, r=5. Then 2*3=6&gt;5. So according to the initial approach, we output -1-1. Which is correct.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another example: l=5, r=10. 2*5=10 &lt;=10. So output 5 and 10.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the initial approach seems correct.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the steps for each test case:</p>\n",
       "<p>Check if 2<em>l &lt;= r. If yes, output l and 2</em>l.</p>\n",
       "<p>Else, check if there exists any pair (x, x+1) where their LCM is &lt;= r. But how?</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, when 2*l &gt; r, but l and r are consecutive. For example, l=3, r=4. Then possible pairs are (3,4). LCM is 12&gt;4. So no.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another example: l=2, r=3. 2*2=4&gt;3. So check if any pairs. (2,3) has LCM 6&gt;3. So output -1-1.</p>\n",
       "<p>But wait, in the sample input's third test case, l=2, r=4. 2*2=4&lt;=4. So output 2 and4.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the initial approach works.</p>\n",
       "<p>But the sample input's first test case: l=1, r=1337. 2*1=2 &lt;=1337. So output 1 and 2. But the sample output is 6 and7.</p>\n",
       "<p>But according to the problem statement, any valid pair is acceptable. So why does the sample output choose a different pair? Because the code can output any valid pair, and 1 and 2 is a valid pair. So why isn't that the sample's answer?</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, looking at the sample input's first output line: 6 7. The LCM is 6<em>7=42 (since they are coprime). Which is between 1 and 1337. So that's valid. But according to the approach of outputting l and 2</em>l, the answer would be 1 and 2. So why isn't that the sample's output? Because the problem allows any pair. So perhaps the sample's answer is just one possible solution, and the code can output any pair.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the initial approach of checking if 2*l &lt;= r would output a valid pair. Hence, the code can be written as:</p>\n",
       "<p>For each test case:</p>\n",

       "<p>Else: output -1 -1.</p>\n",
       "<p>But wait, there's a case where 2*l &gt; r, but there's another pair that works.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, let's take l=3 and r=6. 2*3=6 &lt;=6. So output 3 and6.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another example: l=4, r=6. 2*4=8&gt;6. So according to the code, output -1-1. But possible pairs are (4,6). LCM is 12&gt;6. So no. So code is correct.</p>\n",

       "<p>So in all cases, the code would output a valid pair if 2<em>l &lt;= r, else -1-1. Because when 2</em>l &gt; r, there are no possible pairs where one is a multiple of the other, and other pairs have LCMs that are larger than r.</p>\n",
       "<p>But wait, is there a case where 2*l &gt; r but there exists a pair where LCM is &lt;= r?</p>\n",
       "<p>Let's think. Suppose l=6, r=10. 2*6=12&gt;10. So code says output -1-1. But possible pairs:</p>\n",
       "<p>6 and 9: LCM is 18&gt;10. No.</p>\n",
       "<p>6 and 8: LCM 24&gt;10.</p>\n",
       "<p>7 and 8: LCM 56&gt;10.</p>\n",
       "<p>No pairs. So code is correct.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another example: l=3, r=7. 2*3=6&lt;=7. So code outputs 3 and6.</p>\n",
       "<p>Yes.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another example: l=7, r=14. 2*7=14 &lt;=14. So code outputs 7 and14. LCM is 14, which is between 7 and14.</p>\n",
       "<p>So correct.</p>\n",
       "<p>So this approach seems to cover all possible valid cases.</p>\n",
       "<p>Thus, the code can be written as:</p>\n",
       "<p>For each test case, read l and r.</p>\n",
       "<p>If l *2 &lt;= r:</p>\n",

       "\n",
       "<p>But wait, let's look at the sample input's third test case:</p>\n",
       "<p>Input is 2 4. So l=2, r=4. 2*2=4 &lt;=4. So code outputs 2 and4. Which matches the sample.</p>\n",

       "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the maximum length of a strictly increasing sequence by taking elements from either the left or right end of the array each time. And then output the sequence of moves (L or R) that achieves this. </p>\n",
       "<p>First, I need to understand the approach. Since each element is distinct and all are from 1 to n, perhaps there's a pattern here. Wait, the array is a permutation of 1..n. That's important.</p>\n",
       "<p>The key is that the sequence we take must be strictly increasing. So each next element we take must be larger than the last. Let's think about how to model this.</p>\n",
       "<p>Let me think about possible approaches. One common approach for such two-pointer problems is to greedily choose the smaller possible next element. But wait, no. Wait, because we need the sequence to be strictly increasing, so each next element must be larger than the previous. So the first element is the smallest possible. Then, each subsequent element must be the next possible in the sequence.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, maybe not. Because the sequence must be as long as possible. So we need to choose elements in such a way that each next step picks the smallest possible element that's larger than the last, but considering that we can take from either end.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as finding the longest possible path where each step is choosing left or right such that the selected element is larger than the previous. The optimal path here would be the one that allows the maximum length.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how do we model this? The brute force approach would be to consider all possible choices at each step, but with n up to 2e5, that's impossible. So we need a smarter approach.</p>\n",
       "<p>Let me think. Since the array is a permutation of 1 to n, each number is unique and the sequence must form a strictly increasing sequence. The maximum possible length is n, which is possible only if the array is already sorted in increasing order. For example, if the array is 1,2,3,4,5, then taking all left (LLL) gives the sequence 1,2,3,4,5, which is strictly increasing.</p>\n",
       "<p>But when the array is not sorted, the maximum length depends on the possible paths we can take. Let's think about how to model this.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another idea: the problem is similar to finding the longest increasing subsequence (LIS), but with the constraints that the elements must be taken from the ends. So the LIS approach won't directly work here.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but the LIS approach uses dynamic programming. Maybe here we can model the problem using a two-pointer approach with some dynamic programming. Let's see.</p>\n",
       "<p>Suppose we have two pointers, left and right, at the current ends of the remaining array. At each step, we can choose either left or right, but the chosen element must be larger than the last one taken.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how do we track the last element taken and the possible left and right pointers? This seems like a problem that could be O(n) time, but we need to find a way to model it.</p>\n",
       "<p>Let's think about the possible cases. Let's denote that the last element taken was 'last'. The next element must be larger than 'last'. The possible choices are the leftmost or the rightmost element of the current array.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the problem reduces to choosing between left and right such that the chosen element is larger than 'last', and the resulting path is the longest possible.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to compute this efficiently?</p>\n",
       "<p>An alternative approach: since the elements are a permutation of 1..n, the maximum possible sequence would be 1,2,3,...,k, where each next element is the next number. Wait, no. Because the order in the array may not allow that. But perhaps the sequence is determined by the order of the numbers in the array.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, perhaps the optimal sequence starts with the minimal possible element. Because once you take a higher element, you can't take any smaller elements after that. So maybe the optimal strategy is to start with the minimal possible, then the next minimal possible in the remaining elements that can be taken from either end.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to find the longest possible sequence.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another idea: the problem is similar to the greedy approach for LIS where you build the sequence by taking the smallest possible next element.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, here's an example from the first sample input: [2,1,5,4,3]. The optimal sequence is 2,3,4,5. The next elements after 2 could be 1 (but 1 is smaller) or 3 (from the right). So the choice is to take 3. Then from the remaining elements [1,5,4], the next element can be 4 (right) then 5 (right). So the sequence is built by taking the next possible element that's larger than the last, and allows the longest possible continuation.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to model this decision process.</p>\n",
       "<p>Let me think about the algorithm. Let's try to model the possible choices at each step, but in a way that can be computed efficiently.</p>\n",
       "<p>Here's an approach:</p>\n",
       "<p>Initialize two pointers, left=0 and right=n-1. The current sequence is empty. The last value is -infinity.</p>\n",
       "<p>We need to choose either a[left] or a[right], whichever is larger than last, and allows the maximum possible sequence length. Then, proceed recursively.</p>\n",
       "<p>But this approach would be O(2^n), which is not feasible. So we need a way to compute this in linear time.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternative approach: since the elements are a permutation, perhaps the optimal sequence is a consecutive sequence of numbers starting from some x, and increasing by 1 each step. But not sure.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, perhaps the optimal sequence can be formed by taking elements from either end such that each next element is the smallest possible possible value that is larger than the last. This way, we allow more choices for future steps.</p>\n",
       "<p>For example, if after taking the current element, the next possible elements are 3 and 5. Taking 3 allows the next step to take 4 if available, whereas taking 5 would not allow any elements between 5 and 5 (since all are unique). So taking the smaller possible next element (3) would allow a longer sequence.</p>\n",
       "<p>This suggests a greedy approach where, at each step, we choose the smaller of the two possible options (left and right) that is larger than the last, as long as that choice allows a longer sequence.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to implement this.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, here's an idea inspired by the two-pointer approach:</p>\n",
       "<p>We can greedily choose the smaller possible element between left and right, provided that it's larger than the last. Then proceed. The idea is that by taking the smaller possible next element, we can maximize the remaining options for subsequent steps.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the steps would be:</p>\n",
       "<p>Initialize left = 0, right = n-1.</p>\n",
       "<p>current_last = 0 (or the initial element's value minus 1)</p>\n",

       "<p>Initial left=0 (2), right=4 (3). current_last is 0.</p>\n",
       "<p>a[left] is 2 &gt;0, a[right] is 3&gt;0. So we choose the smaller one, which is 2. Append L. current_last becomes 2. left becomes 1 (value 1). Now, in next step, left is 1, right is4. a[left] is 1 (&lt;=2), a[right] is3&gt;2. So take R. append R. current_last is3. right becomes3 (4). Now, left is1 (1), right is3 (4). a[left] is1 &lt;=3, a[right]4&gt;3. So take R. append R. current_last is4. right becomes2 (5). Now, left is1 (1), right is2 (5). both 1 and5 are &gt;4. take the smaller one, 5 is not smaller than 5? Wait, wait, 5 is larger than current_last (4). So choose the smaller between a[left] and a[right] which are 1 and5. Wait, a[left] is1, which is less than current_last 4? So only a[right] is 5&gt;4. So in this step, the code would take 5 (right). append R. So the sequence becomes LRRR. Which is the correct sample output. Then, after taking 5, current_last is5. Now left is1, right is2. The remaining elements are [1,5]. But both are 1 (left) and5 (right). Both are &lt;=5. So we stop. So the sequence is 4 elements. Which matches the sample.</p>\n",
       "<p>Hmm, but wait in the sample, the code would proceed to take 3,4,5. Wait, the sample's output is 2,3,4,5. So how does that happen?</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, the sample input is [2,1,5,4,3]. Let's walk through:</p>\n",
       "<p>After taking 2 (L), the array becomes [1,5,4,3]. Then take right (3) (R). current_last is3. Then take right (4) (R). current_last is4. Then take right (5) (R). current_last is5. So the sequence is 2,3,4,5. Which is correct.</p>\n",
       "<p>But according to the code I thought of earlier, after taking 3 (R), the next options are [1,5,4]. The left is 1 (a[left] is1, which is &lt;=3. So the code would take the right, which is4. Then current_last is4. The next elements are [5]. So take R (5). So sequence is LRRR, which is correct.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the code seems to work for that case.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another sample input: the third sample is [1,2,3], output LLL. So the code would take left (1), then left (2), then left (3). Correct.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another sample input: 1 2 4 3. Output is 4, LLRL. Let's see:</p>\n",
       "<p>Initial array: [1,2,4,3]. The code would take left (1), then left (2), then right (3) would be invalid (since current_last is2. 4 is larger, so take left (4), append L. Then right is3, which is larger than4. So take R. So the sequence is 1,2,4,3. Wait but that's not increasing. Oh wait no. Wait the sample output is LLRL. Let's see the actual steps:</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, the correct output for input 4 is 4 elements, LLRL. So the sequence is 1,2,4,3. But that's not strictly increasing. Wait that can't be. Oh no, I must have made a mistake. Wait the sample input is [1,2,4,3], and the output is 4. So how is that possible?</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait the sample input is 4: [1,2,4,3]. The output is LLRL, which would take elements as follows: L (1), L (2), R (3), then L (4)? Wait no. Wait the array is [1,2,4,3]. Let's see the steps:</p>\n",
       "<p>First L: take 1. Remaining array [2,4,3]. Then L: take 2. Remaining array [4,3]. Then R: take 3. Next, the remaining array is [4]. So take L (4). So the sequence is 1,2,3,4. Wait that's strictly increasing. So the steps are LLLR. Wait but the sample output is LLRL. Wait maybe there's another way. Hmm.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait the sample output is 4, LLRL. Let's see:</p>\n",
       "<p>First L:1. Remaining [2,4,3]. Then L:2. Remaining [4,3]. Then R:3. But 3 is larger than 2, yes. Then take L (4). So the sequence is 1,2,3,4. So the moves are L, L, R, L → \"LLRL\". Oh right. Because after taking 3 (from the right), the remaining array is [4]. So the next move is L (take 4). So the sequence is indeed 1,2,3,4. So the code's approach would work here.</p>\n",
       "<p>So in this case, the code's approach would proceed as follows:</p>\n",
       "<p>Initial left=0 (1), right=3 (3). current_last=0. Both 1 and3 are &gt;0. Take the smaller one (1, left). Now current_last=1, left=1.</p>\n",
       "<p>Next left=1 (2), right=3 (3). Both 2 and3 &gt;1. Take the smaller (2, left). current_last=2. left=2. Now, left=2 (4), right=3 (3). a[left]=4&gt;2, a[right]=3&gt;2. So choose the smaller between 4 and3. The smaller is3. So take right (R). Append R. current_last=3. right=2. Now left=2, right=2. a[left] is4&gt;3. Take L. Append L. So the sequence is L L R L. Which matches the sample.</p>\n",
       "<p>So this suggests that the greedy approach of taking the smaller of the two possible options (when both are available) works correctly.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to implement this. Let's think.</p>\n",
       "<p>The algorithm is:</p>\n",
       "<p>Initialize left and right pointers.</p>\n",
       "<p>current_last starts at 0 (or -infinity, as long as it's smaller than any possible element).</p>\n",
       "<p>result is an empty list.</p>\n",
       "<p>loop:</p>\n",
       "<p>if left &gt; right: break.</p>\n",
       "<p>Check if the left and right elements are larger than current_last.</p>\n",
       "<p>If both are larger:</p>\n",
       "<p>choose the one with the smaller value (since taking the smaller allows more options in the future). Because if you take the larger one, then the next step may have no options left. For example, if left is 3 and right is4, and current_last is2. Taking 3 allows next steps to take 4, but taking4 would leave 3, which can't be used.</p>\n",
       "<p>So choosing the smaller one is better.</p>\n",
       "<p>So append 'L' if left element is smaller, else 'R'.</p>\n",
       "<p>Update current_last to that element's value. Move the pointer accordingly.</p>\n",
       "<p>If only one is larger than current_last:</p>\n",
       "<p>take that element, append direction, move pointer.</p>\n",
       "<p>else:</p>\n",
       "<p>break.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the code would look something like:</p>\n",
       "<p>left = 0</p>\n",
       "<p>right = n-1</p>\n",
       "<p>last = -infinity</p>\n",

       "<p>So it seems that the code's approach works for the samples. So perhaps this is the correct approach.</p>\n",
       "<p>But why does this approach work? Let's think about the correctness.</p>\n",
       "<p>The key idea is that whenever both ends are possible (i.e., both are larger than the last taken element), we choose the smaller one. This allows the next step to have as small a value as possible to take next, thereby maximizing the possible remaining choices.</p>\n",
       "<p>For example, if you have a choice between 3 and 4, taking 3 allows you to take 4 later (if available), but taking 4 would not allow you to take 3. Hence, taking the smaller one gives more options in the future.</p>\n",
       "<p>This is a classic greedy approach where choosing the locally optimal choice (smallest possible next element) leads to a globally optimal solution.</p>\n",
       "<p>Thus, the algorithm is correct.</p>\n",
       "<p>Now, let's consider the implementation. The code should be straightforward, using two pointers and a loop.</p>\n",
       "<p>But since n can be up to 2e5, the code must run in O(n) time. The code as described runs in O(n) time, as each step either moves left to the right or right to the left, and each is processed once.</p>\n",
       "<p>Now, let's code this in Python.</p>\n",
       "<p>Read n, read the array. Then left=0, right=n-1. last is initialized to a value smaller than all possible elements (like 0). Then, the loop as described.</p>\n",
       "<p>Now, for handling the output, we can collect the 'L' and 'R's in a list, then output the length and the joined string.</p>\n",
       "<p>Testing edge cases:</p>\n",
       "<p>Test case when the array is sorted in increasing order. Then all left moves. For example, input 3: [1,2,3]. Code takes L, L, L. Correct.</p>\n",
       "<p>Test case when the array is sorted in decreasing order. For example, n=3, [3,2,1]. Then first take left (3). Then next elements (2 and1) are smaller than 3. So sequence length is 1. But wait, but if we take right (1) first. Wait, the code would start with comparing left (3) and right (1). Both &gt;0. Take the smaller (1). So append R. current_last=1. Then left=0 (3), right=1 (2). Both 3 and2&gt;1. Take the smaller (2). Append R. current_last=2. Then left=0 (3). Take L. current_last=3. So sequence is RRL, length 3. So the code would output 3, RRL.</p>\n",
       "<p>But wait, the array is [3,2,1]. How can you take 3 elements? Because 1&gt;2&gt;3 is not increasing. Wait no. The sequence would be 1, 2,3? But how? Because after taking 1 (right), the array becomes [3,2]. Then taking 2 (right), array becomes [3]. Then take 3 (left). The sequence is 1,2,3. Which is increasing. So the code's approach works here.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the code works even if the array is in reverse order.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another edge case: n=1. Output is 1, L.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another case: n=2, [2,1]. The code takes left (2) and then right (1) is invalid. So sequence is length 1. But if you take right (1), then left (2) is invalid. So maximum is 1. But wait, no. Wait, the array is [2,1]. The possible sequences are taking 2 (L) → sequence [2], or taking 1 (R) → [1]. So maximum length is 1. But according to the code, initial step: left=0 (2), right=1 (1). Both &gt;0. Take the smaller (1). Append R. current_last=1. Then left=0 (2) is larger than 1. So take L. current_last=2. So sequence is RL, which is 1,2. So length 2. Wait, but how?</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, in the array [2,1], the code would proceed as:</p>\n",
       "<p>left=0 (2), right=1 (1). Both are &gt;0. Take the smaller (1). Append R. current_last=1. Then left=0 (2) which is &gt;1. Take L. append L. So the sequence is RL. The elements taken are 1 and2. Which is increasing. So the code would output 2, RL. Which is correct. So in this case, the code produces the optimal solution.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the code works for this case.</p>\n",

       "Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the task is to append at most 3 elements to an array so that the sum of the array equals twice the XOR of all elements. Hmm. Let's think about the conditions required here.</p>\n",
       "<p>First, let's recall that the sum S and the XOR X need to satisfy S = 2 * X. So, the key is to find elements to add such that this equation holds. But how?</p>\n",
       "<p>Let me start by considering the original array. Let's compute the initial sum S and the XOR X of the array. Then, we need to append elements so that after adding, the new sum S' and new XOR X' satisfy S' = 2 * X'.</p>\n",
       "<p>Suppose we add elements b1, b2, ..., bk (k ≤3). Then:</p>\n",
       "<p>S' = S + b1 + ... + bk\n",
       "X' = X ^ b1 ^ ... ^ bk</p>\n",
       "<p>We need S' = 2 * X'</p>\n",
       "<p>So, the problem reduces to finding some k (0, 1, 2, or 3) and elements to add such that this equation holds.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how can we find such elements? Let's think of possible ways.</p>\n",
       "<p>Let's think of possible cases. Let's first check if the original array is already good. If S_initial = 2 * X_initial, then we can output 0 elements. So that's the first check.</p>\n",
       "<p>If not, then we need to add elements.</p>\n",
       "<p>Let's think about adding one element. Suppose we add a single element 'a'. Then:</p>\n",
       "<p>S_new = S + a\n",
       "X_new = X ^ a</p>\n",
       "<p>We need S + a = 2*(X ^ a). Let's see if we can solve for 'a'.</p>\n",
       "<p>But this might not always be possible. So maybe adding one element isn't sufficient, but according to the problem statement, the solution exists with at most three elements.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, maybe adding two elements can work. Or three.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, the problem says that it's always possible, so maybe there's a general approach that works for any array by adding up to three elements.</p>\n",
       "<p>Let's think of a general approach. Let's consider adding three elements. For example, maybe adding x, y, z such that x = y = z. Or perhaps some specific values that make the equation hold.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Let's see the example given in the problem. In the third test case, the input is [1, 1], and the output is adding 2, 6, 2. Let's compute:</p>\n",
       "<p>Original sum S = 1 + 1 = 2\n",
       "Original XOR X = 0 (1 ^ 1 = 0)</p>\n",
       "<p>After adding 2,6,2:</p>\n",
       "<p>New sum: 2 +6 +2 = 10 → total sum 2+10=12\n",
       "New XOR: 0 ^ 2 ^6 ^2 = (0^2^2) ^6 → 0 ^6 =6. So 12 = 2*6 → yes.</p>\n",
       "<p>So here, the three added elements sum to 10 and their XOR is 6. So maybe the approach here was to find three elements whose sum is (2*(new XOR)) - original sum, but I'm not sure.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, let's think of adding two elements. For example, in the second test case, the input is [8]. Original sum is 8, XOR is 8. 8 is not equal to 2<em>8=16, so adding two 4s. Sum becomes 8+4+4=16, XOR is 8^4^4=8. Then 16=2</em>8 → yes.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the two added elements sum to 8 and their XOR is 0 (since 4^4=0), thus the total XOR is 8^0=8. So sum is 16, which is 2*8.</p>\n",
       "<p>Hmm, so adding two elements that are the same gives their XOR as 0. So maybe adding two elements that are equal can be useful.</p>\n",

       "<p>Suppose after adding elements, the sum becomes S', and XOR becomes X'. We need S' = 2X'.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to choose the elements to add.</p>\n",
       "<p>Let me think: Let's consider adding three elements. Maybe the approach is to first add two elements that are equal, and then a third.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, perhaps the following approach works:</p>\n",
       "<p>Suppose the original sum is S, XOR is X.</p>\n",
       "<p>We can add three elements: x, x, y.</p>\n",
       "<p>Let's see:</p>\n",
       "<p>After adding x, x, y:</p>\n",
       "<p>sum_new = S + 2x + y\n",
       "xor_new = X ^ x ^ x ^ y = X ^ y (since x^x is 0, and 0^y is y)</p>\n",

       "<p>Hmm. But how to choose x and y here. Maybe we can set x = some value, then find y.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to make this equation hold by choosing x and y appropriately. Let's suppose we choose x = X, then:</p>\n",
       "<p>sum_new = S + 2X + y\n",
       "xor_new = X ^ y</p>\n",
       "<p>So S + 2X + y = 2 (X ^ y)</p>\n",
       "<p>But not sure how to proceed here. Alternatively, maybe we can set y = (S + 2X) ?</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, let's think of the case when we add two elements. Let's add x and x. Then sum becomes S + 2x. XOR becomes X ^ x ^ x = X. So sum_new = S + 2x, XOR_new = X. Then the condition is S + 2x = 2X → x = (2X - S)/2. But 2X must be &gt;= S and (2X - S) must be even. However, if X and S have the same parity, then 2X - S is even. But if X is even or odd, this depends. Not sure.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, perhaps there's a general approach where we can add elements such that the sum and XOR are adjusted in a way that S' = 2X'.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, here's an idea. Let's consider adding two elements, a and b. Let's set a and b such that when added, the sum and XOR meet the required condition.</p>\n",
       "<p>But I'm not sure. Maybe another approach is needed.</p>\n",
       "<p>Let me think about the properties of sum and XOR. The sum is the sum of all bits in the numbers multiplied by their respective powers, but XOR is the parity (for each bit position, whether there's an odd number of 1s). So the sum and XOR are related but not directly.</p>\n",
       "<p>But for the equation sum = 2 * xor, the sum must be even because 2 * xor is even. So the sum of the array after adding elements must be even. So the first step is to check if the original sum is even. If not, adding elements to make it even.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but adding elements can affect the sum's parity. For example, if the original sum S is even, then adding elements with sum even preserves parity. If S is odd, adding even sum elements would make it odd again, but adding an odd number of elements (sum) would change parity.</p>\n",
       "<p>But perhaps the solution can be found by considering the XOR and sum.</p>\n",
       "<p>Let me think of the case where we add two elements, say x and x. Then the sum increases by 2x, which is even. The XOR of x and x is 0, so the XOR remains the original XOR.</p>\n",
       "<p>So after adding two x's, sum becomes S + 2x, XOR remains X. So we need S + 2x = 2X. Solving for x gives x = (2X - S)/2. But this requires that 2X - S is even and non-negative. But 2X can be less than S, leading to x being negative, which is not allowed (since elements are non-negative). So this approach would work only if 2X &gt;= S and (2X - S) is even.</p>\n",
       "<p>But if that's possible, then adding two elements x = (2X - S)/2 would solve the problem. However, if that's not possible, perhaps adding three elements is needed.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, suppose we add three elements. Let's see: Let's set the three elements as a, a, and b. Then sum increases by 2a + b, and XOR becomes X ^ a ^ a ^ b = X ^ b.

       "<p>sum_new = S + 2X + b\n",

       "<p>We can rearrange this to:</p>\n",
       "<p>b = 2 (X ^ b) - (S + 2X)</p>\n",
       "<p>Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps setting a = X and b = S + X.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, let's try substituting. Let's see:</p>\n",
       "<p>sum_new = S + 2X + (S + X) = S + 2X + S + X = 2S + 3X.</p>\n",

       "<p>But S could be anything, so this might not simplify. Hmm. Not helpful.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, maybe there's a different way. Let's think of adding three elements, x, y, z, such that their sum is A and their XOR is B. Then the total sum is S + A, and the total XOR is X ^ B. Then we need S + A = 2*(X ^ B). How to choose A and B?</p>\n",
       "<p>But perhaps there's a way to choose x, y, z such that their sum is 2*(X ^ B) - S, and their XOR is B. But this seems circular.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, perhaps we can choose B to be (S + A)/2. But not sure.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, here's a different approach. Let's suppose we add three elements. Let's choose two elements to be X, and the third element to be X + S. Let's see:</p>\n",

       "<p>So sum_new must equal 2 * xor_new. So 2S + 3X = 2 * S → 3X = 0 → X=0, which is only possible if X=0. So this approach only works in specific cases.</p>\n",
       "<p>Hmm, maybe this isn't the right path. Let's think of another approach.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, the problem states that the solution always exists with at most three elements. Let's see what the examples do.</p>\n",
       "<p>In the third test case, the original array is [1, 1]. Sum is 2, XOR is 0. We need sum_new = 2 * xor_new. So possible sum_new could be 12, xor_new 6 as in the example.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, the added elements are 2,6,2. Sum added is 2+6+2=10. Sum_new is 12, xor_new is 0 ^ 2 ^6 ^2 = 6. 12 = 2*6.</p>\n",
       "<p>So how did they get these numbers?</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, perhaps the added elements are constructed as follows: Let's add three elements, two of which are the same. Let's say x, y, x. Then their XOR is x ^ y ^ x = y. So the total XOR is X ^ y. The sum added is 2x + y. So sum_new = S + 2x + y. And we need S + 2x + y = 2 (X ^ y).</p>\n",
       "<p>So maybe we can set x = X, and then choose y such that:</p>\n",
       "<p>S + 2X + y = 2 (X ^ y)</p>\n",
       "<p>We can solve for y here. Let's rearrange:</p>\n",
       "<p>y = 2(X ^ y) - (S + 2X)</p>\n",
       "<p>But this equation is tricky. Let's try substituting some values.</p>\n",
       "<p>In the third test case, original S=2, X=0. Let's set x=0.</p>\n",
       "<p>Then equation becomes: 2 + 0 + y = 2 (0 ^ y) → 2 + y = 2y → y=2.</p>\n",
       "<p>So sum added would be 2<em>0 + 2 = 2. Sum_new is 2+2=4. XOR_new is 0 ^ 0 ^0 ^2=2. Then 4=2</em>2. So that's correct. So adding three elements 0,0,2 would work. But in the example, they added 2,6,2. So perhaps this approach works.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but in that case, why not add three elements 0,0,2? The sum would be 2+0+0+2=4, XOR is 0^0^0^2=2. 4=2*2. So that's correct. So the answer could be adding three elements 0,0,2. But the example uses 2,6,2. Hmm, so there are multiple possible solutions.</p>\n",
       "<p>So this approach might work. Let's try to formalize it.</p>\n",
       "<p>The idea is to add three elements: x, x, and y. Let x be the original XOR value of the array. Then:</p>\n",
       "<p>sum_new = S + 2x + y</p>\n",
       "<p>xor_new = X ^ x ^ x ^ y = X ^ y (since x^x is 0, and X is the original XOR, which is x in this case).</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, no. Wait, the original XOR is X, and we add x, x, y. So the new XOR is X ^ x ^ x ^ y = X ^ y.</p>\n",
       "<p>But since we set x = X, then the new XOR becomes X ^ y. But sum_new is S + 2X + y.</p>\n",

       "<p>S + 2X + y = 2 * (X ^ y)</p>\n",
       "<p>So solving for y:</p>\n",
       "<p>y = 2*(X ^ y) - (S + 2X)</p>\n",
       "<p>But this is a bit of a circular equation. Let's see if we can find a y that satisfies this.</p>\n",
       "<p>Let's rearrange:</p>\n",
       "<p>y + S + 2X = 2*(X ^ y)</p>\n",
       "<p>So, for example, in the third test case where S=2 and X=0 (original array is [1,1], sum 2, XOR 0), and x is 0 (X), then:</p>\n",
       "<p>y + 2 + 0<em>2 = 2</em>(0 ^ y) → y + 2 = 2y → y=2. So adding 0,0,2 would work.</p>\n",
       "<p>But in the example, they added 2,6,2. Let's see:</p>\n",
       "<p>sum_new is 2 + 2+6+2 = 12. XOR is 0 ^2 ^6 ^2=6. 12=2*6. So that's correct.</p>\n",
       "<p>So why choose those numbers? Let's see if there's a pattern here.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, when adding three elements, perhaps the first two are x and x, and the third is (X ^ (some value)). Hmm, not sure.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, maybe the approach is to add three elements such that their sum is (2 * (X ^ y)) - S, where y is their XOR. But how?</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, here's a different approach: For any array, we can add three elements to make the equation hold. Let's think of adding three elements as follows:</p>\n",
       "<p>Add elements x, y, z, where x = a, y = b, z = a + b + c. Wait, not sure.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, perhaps we can always add three elements: X, X + S, and something else. Let's try.</p>\n",
       "<p>But perhaps the key is that for any initial array, adding three elements can solve the problem regardless of the initial sum and XOR.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, let's think again. Let's assume that after adding three elements, the sum and XOR must satisfy sum_new = 2 * xor_new. Let's assume that the three elements are a, b, c.</p>\n",
       "<p>sum_new = S + a + b + c\n",
       "xor_new = X ^ a ^ b ^ c</p>\n",
       "<p>We need:</p>\n",
       "<p>S + a + b + c = 2 * (X ^ a ^ b ^ c)</p>\n",
       "<p>Let me set the variables as follows: Let xor_three = a ^ b ^ c. Then the equation is sum_three = 2 * (X ^ xor_three) - S, where sum_three is a + b + c.</p>\n",
       "<p>So sum_three = 2*(X ^ xor_three) - S.</p>\n",
       "<p>But sum_three is a + b + c, and xor_three is a ^ b ^ c.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how can we choose a, b, c such that this equation holds?</p>\n",
       "<p>This seems like a system of equations, but solving it for a, b, c is not straightforward. But perhaps there's a way to choose a, b, c such that their sum and xor are chosen in a way that allows this.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, here's a possible approach:</p>\n",
       "<p>Set a = X, b = (sum_original + X), c = 0. Then:</p>\n",
       "<p>sum_three = X + (S + X) + 0 = S + 2X.</p>\n",
       "<p>xor_three = X ^ (S + X) ^ 0 = X ^ (S + X) ^ 0. Let's compute X ^ (S+X) = S (since X ^ (S+X) = (X ^ X) ^ S = 0 ^ S = S).</p>\n",
       "<p>So xor_three = S.</p>\n",
       "<p>So sum_new = S + (S + 2X) = 2S + 2X.</p>\n",
       "<p>xor_new = X ^ (X ^ (S + X) ^ 0) = X ^ S.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, no. The original XOR is X, and adding a, b, c:</p>\n",
       "<p>new XOR is X ^ a ^ b ^ c.</p>\n",
       "<p>In this case, a is X, b is S+X, c is 0. So:</p>\n",
       "<p>X ^ X ^ (S+X) ^ 0 = (X ^ X) ^ (S+X) ^ 0 → 0 ^ (S+X) ^ 0 → S+X.</p>\n",
       "<p>So xor_new is S + X.</p>\n",
       "<p>sum_new = S + (X + S+X + 0) = S + (2X + S) = 2S + 2X.</p>\n",
       "<p>We need sum_new = 2 * xor_new → 2S + 2X = 2*(S + X) → 2S + 2X = 2S + 2X → which holds. So this works!</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, this is interesting. So if we add three elements: X, (S + X), and 0, then the sum_new is 2S + 2X, and the xor_new is S + X. So sum_new is exactly twice the xor_new. Thus, the condition is satisfied.</p>\n",
       "<p>But wait, let's double-check:</p>\n",
       "<p>sum_three = X + (S+X) + 0 = X + S + X + 0 = S + 2X.</p>\n",
       "<p>sum_new = S + sum_three = S + S + 2X = 2S + 2X.</p>\n",
       "<p>xor_three = X ^ (S+X) ^ 0. Let's compute X ^ (S+X) = (X ^ X) ^ S = 0 ^ S = S. Then S ^ 0 = S. So xor_three = S.</p>\n",
       "<p>xor_new = original_X ^ xor_three → X ^ S.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, wait. Original XOR is X. Then adding a, b, c (X, S+X, 0) gives new XOR as X ^ X ^ (S+X) ^ 0.</p>\n",
       "<p>X ^ X is 0. Then 0 ^ (S+X) is S+X. Then (S+X) ^ 0 is S+X. So the new XOR is X ^ a ^ b ^ c = S+X.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, that's conflicting with the previous calculation. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, let's recompute:</p>\n",
       "<p>Original XOR is X.</p>\n",
       "<p>After adding elements X, S+X, 0:</p>\n",
       "<p>new XOR is X ^ X ^ (S+X) ^ 0.</p>\n",
       "<p>X ^ X is 0. Then 0 ^ (S+X) is S+X. Then (S+X) ^ 0 is S+X. So new XOR is S+X.</p>\n",
       "<p>Sum new is S + X + (S+X) + 0 = S + X + S + X = 2S + 2X.</p>\n",
       "<p>Which is 2*(S+X) → sum new is 2 * new XOR. So this works.</p>\n",
       "<p>Yes! So by adding three elements: X, S+X, 0, the equation holds. So this is a general solution that works for any array. However, the problem allows adding up to three elements, so if the original array already satisfies the condition, we can output zero elements. Otherwise, we can add these three elements.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but what if X is 0? For example, in the third test case, original X is 0. Then the three elements would be 0, S + 0, 0 → 0, 2, 0. So the added elements are 0,2,0. The sum of added elements is 0+2+0=2. So sum_new is 2 (original sum) + 2 =4. The new XOR is 0 ^0 ^2 ^0=2. 4=2*2 → correct.</p>\n",
       "<p>So in this case, adding three elements [0,2,0] would solve it. But the example uses a different solution. So why?</p>\n",
       "<p>Because the problem allows any valid solution, not necessarily this one. So this approach works.</p>\n",
       "<p>But wait, the three elements added are X, S+X, 0. However, in some cases, S+X could be very large. But the problem allows elements up to 1e18, so that's acceptable.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the general approach is:</p>\n",
       "<p>For each test case:</p>\n",
       "<ol>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>Compute sum S and XOR X of the original array.</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>If S == 2*X, output 0 elements.</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>Else, output three elements: X, (S + X), 0.</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "</ol>\n",
       "<p>But wait, adding three elements. Let's test this approach against the examples.</p>\n",
       "<p>First example:</p>\n",
       "<p>Input array [1,2,3,6]. Sum S=12, XOR X=1^2^3^6 = (1^2=3, 3^3=0, 0^6=6). So X=6. S=12, 2<em>X=12. So S=2</em>X → output 0. Which matches the example.</p>\n",
       "<p>Second example:</p>\n",
       "<p>Input [8]. S=8, X=8. 8 != 2<em>8 → 16. So need to add three elements: 8, 8+8=16, 0 → elements are 8,16,0. Sum after adding is 8 +8+16+0 =32. XOR is 8 ^8^16^0 → 0 ^16^0=16. 32=2</em>16 → correct. But the example adds two elements (4,4). So adding three elements would also work, but the example found a solution with two elements. So our approach would output three elements, but the problem allows any solution.</p>\n",
       "<p>But the problem says that the solution must append at most three elements. So adding three is allowed, but sometimes there is a solution with fewer elements.</p>\n",
       "<p>So perhaps there's a smarter approach to find whether adding one or two elements suffices.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the steps could be:</p>\n",
       "<p>Check if the original array is good. If yes, output 0.</p>\n",
       "<p>Else, check if adding one element works. If yes, output that.</p>\n",
       "<p>Else, check if adding two elements works. If yes, output that.</p>\n",
       "<p>Else, add three elements (the X, S+X, 0 approach).</p>\n",
       "<p>But checking for adding one or two elements might complicate the code, especially under time constraints. So perhaps the problem can be solved by always adding two elements in some cases and three in others, but the solution with three elements is always possible.</p>\n",
       "<p>But for code submission, perhaps the simplest approach is to check if the original array is good. If not, check if adding two elements works. If not, add three.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to check if adding two elements is possible?</p>\n",
       "<p>Let's think again. Suppose we add two elements x and x. Then sum becomes S + 2x. XOR becomes X ^ x ^ x = X. So sum_new must equal 2*X. So:</p>\n",
       "<p>S + 2x = 2X → x = (2X - S)/2.</p>\n",
       "<p>But x has to be a non-negative integer. So (2X - S) must be even and non-negative.</p>\n",
       "<p>So for x to be valid, 2X &gt;= S and (2X - S) is even.</p>\n",
       "<p>If that's the case, then adding two elements of x = (2X - S)/2 would suffice.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the steps would be:</p>\n",
       "<p>Compute S and X.</p>\n",
       "<p>If S == 2X → output 0.</p>\n",
       "<p>Else, check if 2X &gt;= S and (2X - S) is even. If so, add two elements of (2X - S)/2.</p>\n",
       "<p>Else, add three elements: X, S+X, 0.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but in the example where the input is [8], let's see:</p>\n",
       "<p>Original S=8, X=8. 2X =16. 8 != 16. So check 2X &gt;= S → 16 &gt;=8 → yes. (2X - S) is 8, which is even. So x = 8/2=4. So adding two 4s. Which is the solution in the example.</p>\n",
       "<p>Yes. So in this case, adding two elements works.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another example: the third test case, original S=2, X=0. 2X=0. S=2 !=0. Check 2X=0 &gt;= S=2? 0 &gt;=2 is false. So can't add two elements. So must add three.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the general approach is:</p>\n",
       "<p>For each test case:</p>\n",
       "<p>Compute S and X.</p>\n",
       "<p>If S == 2X → output 0.</p>\n",
       "<p>Else:</p>\n",
       "<p>Check if 2X &gt;= S and (2X - S) is even. If yes, then output two elements: (2X - S)/2 and (2X - S)/2.</p>\n",
       "<p>Else, output three elements: X, X + S, 0.</p>\n",
       "<p>But wait, in the case when adding two elements is possible, why isn't the problem example adding three elements? Because the problem allows any solution, and adding two is better.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the code needs to first check for the possibility of adding two elements. If not possible, add three.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the code steps would be:</p>\n",
       "<p>For each test case:</p>\n",
       "<p>Compute S as sum of array.</p>\n",

       "Okay, let's see. The problem is to determine if we can replace the question marks in a given string such that the resulting string contains exactly one occurrence of \"abacaba\" as a substring. And if possible, output the modified string. </p>\n",
       "<p>First, let's understand the problem. The target substring is \"abacaba\", which is 7 characters long. So for a string of length n, possible positions where this substring can start are from 0 to n-7 (assuming 0-based indexing). </p>\n",
       "<p>The main steps I need to perform are:</p>\n",
       "<ol>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>For each test case, check all possible positions where \"abacaba\" can be placed. For each position i, check if it's possible to replace the question marks in the string such that the substring starting at i is exactly \"abacaba\", and that there are no other occurrences of \"abacaba\" in the string (even overlapping ones). </p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>Once such a position is found, replace all other question marks with some other letters (like 'z') to avoid creating another \"abacaba\". But we have to make sure that after replacing, the rest of the string doesn't contain any other instances of \"abacaba\".</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>If any of these positions works, then output \"Yes\" and the modified string. Otherwise, output \"No\".</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "</ol>\n",
       "<p>Hmm, but how do we check for possible overlaps? For example, if the original string has some characters that, when modified, could form another \"abacaba\" outside of the chosen position. </p>\n",
       "<p>Let's think about the approach:</p>\n",
       "<p>For each possible position i (from 0 to n-7), try to place \"abacaba\" starting at i. To do this, check if the existing characters in the string at positions i to i+6 (assuming 0-based) are compatible with \"abacaba\". That is, for each of these positions, if the existing character is not a question mark, it must match the corresponding character in \"abacaba\". If any of them doesn't match (and is not a '?'), then this position i is invalid. </p>\n",
       "<p>Once we find a valid position i where we can place \"abacaba\", then we replace the question marks in those 7 positions with the required letters, and replace all other question marks with other letters (like 'a' or 'z', but carefully to avoid creating other \"abacaba\" instances). </p>\n",
       "<p>But then, after replacing the other question marks, we need to check if the entire modified string has exactly one occurrence of \"abacaba\". Because even after placing it at i, other parts of the string (including overlapping regions) might form \"abacaba\" when we replace the question marks. </p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but how? For example, suppose after placing \"abacaba\" at position i, there's another part of the string that, when we replace the question marks with some letters, becomes another \"abacaba\". So we need to make sure that, in the modified string, there's only one occurrence. </p>\n",
       "<p>But the problem is that when we replace the other question marks (those not in the i-th substring), we have to choose letters such that they don't form another \"abacaba\". But how? Because when we replace those with arbitrary letters, we might accidentally create another occurrence. </p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but the approach would be:</p>\n",
       "<p>Once we decide to place \"abacaba\" at position i, replace all other question marks with a fixed letter (like 'z') that doesn't interfere. Then, check the entire string to see if there are any other occurrences of \"abacaba\". If not, then this is a valid solution. </p>\n",
       "<p>But this might not be efficient. For example, when n is up to 50, and T is 5000, the total steps would be manageable. Let's see. For each test case, for each possible i (up to 44 positions for n=50), we need to check if placing \"abacaba\" at i is possible, and then check if the resulting string (after replacing other '?'s) has exactly one occurrence. </p>\n",
       "<p>So the steps would be:</p>\n",
       "<p>For each test case:</p>\n",
       "<p>Loop over each possible i (0 &lt;= i &lt;= n-7):</p>\n",
       "<p>Check if the current characters from i to i+6 can be made into \"abacaba\". That is, for each of the 7 positions j in i to i+6:</p>\n",

       "<p>If any of the i positions leads to a candidate with exactly one occurrence, then output \"Yes\" and the candidate string. If none do, output \"No\".</p>\n",
       "<p>But wait, even after replacing the other '?'s with 'z's, could there be another occurrence of \"abacaba\" that overlaps with the original i? For example, suppose the original string is such that after replacement, there's another occurrence starting at i+1. </p>\n",
       "<p>Yes. So even though we placed \"abacaba\" at i, other parts of the string (including overlapping regions) could form another occurrence. So we need to check the entire candidate string for the number of occurrences. </p>\n",
       "<p>But generating the candidate string and checking for occurrences is feasible. Since the candidate string is up to 50 characters, checking all possible positions (up to 44) each time for \"abacaba\" is manageable. </p>\n",
       "<p>So the plan is:</p>\n",
       "<p>For each possible i where the substring can be placed:</p>\n",
       "<ol>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>Check if the existing characters (non '?') in s from i to i+6 are compatible with \"abacaba\".</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>If compatible, create a candidate string where those positions are filled with \"abacaba\", and all other '?' are replaced with 'z' (or any other character, but perhaps choosing a character that doesn't form parts of the target string).</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>Then, count how many times \"abacaba\" appears in the candidate string. If exactly once, then this is a valid solution.</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "</ol>\n",
       "<p>So, the key steps are:</p>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>Iterate over all possible i positions.</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "<li>\n",

       "<li>\n",
       "<p>Build the candidate string.</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",

       "<p>If after checking all i's and none work, return \"No\".</p>\n",
       "<p>Now, the next step is to code this.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to implement this efficiently?</p>\n",
       "<p>First, the target is \"abacaba\". Let's note that the target has some overlapping possibilities. For example, the substring \"aba\" can start at positions 0 and 2 in \"abacaba\". So overlapping occurrences are possible. So when we place \"abacaba\" at position i, we need to check if any other occurrence exists in the candidate string.</p>\n",
       "<p>But the candidate string is built by replacing all other '?'s with 'z's (or other letters). So the parts outside the i..i+6 substring are fixed as 'z's (or whatever), except the original non-'?' characters. So when building the candidate string, the other parts (non-i..i+6) may have letters that could form the target.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but the original string may have some letters that are not '?', which when combined with the replaced '?'s could form \"abacaba\" in other positions.</p>\n",
       "<p>For example, suppose the original string is \"ab?????\" (n=7). If we choose to replace the first position (i=0), then the candidate becomes \"abacaba\". But the original string's first two characters are 'a' and 'b'. Then, the replaced string would be \"abacaba\", which has exactly one occurrence. But if the original string was \"abac????\", then placing \"abacaba\" at i=0 would require that the 3rd character is 'a' (from the target), but if the original third character was 'c', then that's incompatible.</p>\n",
       "<p>But when building the candidate string, the other non-i positions (i.e., positions not in i..i+6) are filled as follows:</p>\n",
       "<p>For each position j in 0..n-1:</p>\n",
       "<p>if j is in i..i+6: set to the corresponding character from \"abacaba\".</p>\n",

       "<p>Wait, no. The process is:</p>\n",
       "<p>In the candidate string, the substring i to i+6 must be \"abacaba\". The other characters must be the original characters if they are not '?', and replaced with 'z' (or some other fixed character) if they are '?'. </p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, yes. Because the problem allows replacing '?'s with any letters. So when building the candidate, for positions not in the i..i+6 substring:</p>\n",

       "<p>To check occurrences:</p>\n",
       "<p>We can loop over all possible starting positions k in 0 to len(candidate) -7:</p>\n",
       "<p>Check if candidate[k:k+7] == target. Count how many times this is true.</p>\n",

       "<p>Now, considering that for each test case, the maximum number of i positions is up to 44 (when n=50), and for each i, the check is O(n) (for the candidate), the total operations per test case are up to 44 * 50 * 50 (since for each candidate, checking all possible positions takes up to 44 steps again). Wait, no. For the candidate string, the length is up to 50, so checking all possible k (from 0 to 50-7=43) for the target (7 characters each time) would take up to 44 *7 operations. But 50 is small, so even with 5000 test cases, the total operations would be acceptable.</p>\n",
       "<p>So this approach is feasible.</p>\n",
       "<p>Now, let's look at the sample input.</p>\n",
       "<p>Sample Input 1:</p>\n",

       "<p>Sample Output: Yes, same string. The candidate is the original string, which has exactly one occurrence. So in this case, the code would check i=0. The existing characters are exactly \"abacaba\", so compatible. Then the candidate is the same, and count is 1. So returns yes.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another test case: 7 ???????. The code would try i=0. The candidate would be \"abacaba\" followed by replacing other '?' (there are none). So the candidate is \"abacaba\", count is 1. So returns yes.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another example: 11 aba?abacaba. The code would check possible i's. Let's see: the original string is \"aba?abacaba\" (n=11). When i=4 (assuming 0-based), the substring from 4 to 10 is \"abacaba\". Let's see:</p>\n",

       "<p>Wait, the target is 7 characters. So for i=4, positions 4,5,6,7,8,9,10 would be replaced with 'a','b','a','c','a','b','a'. So the original string's fourth position (index 3) is a '?', but in this case, i=4 would start at index 4. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the indices wrong.</p>\n",

       "<p>Indices 0: a, 1: b, 2: a, 3: ?, 4: a, 5: b, 6: a, 7: c, 8: a, 9: b, 10: a.</p>\n",
       "<p>If we choose i=3 (so positions 3-9):</p>\n",

       "<p>position 3: ? (okay), position 4: a (must match target's 1st character (a). Wait, target's index 0 is 'a', so for i=3, position 3 is target[0], which is 'a'. Then position 4 (i=3 +1) is target[1] 'b'. But the original string's position4 is 'a', which does not match. So this i=3 is invalid. </p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, perhaps the correct i is 4. Let's see. For i=4, the target is positions 4-10. The target letters would be a, b, a, c, a, b, a. Original positions 4: a, 5: b, 6: a, 7: c, 8: a, 9: b, 10: a. So the original characters here are a, b, a, c, a, b, a. Which matches the target. So i=4 is possible. Then the candidate string would have these positions as target, and other positions:</p>\n",
       "<p>positions 0-3: original a, b, a, ?. Since i=4, these are not in the target's positions. The '?' at position3 is replaced with 'z'. So the candidate would be a, b, a, z, a, b, a, c, a, b, a. Then, check for occurrences of \"abacaba\". The substring starts at i=4 (positions4-10) is \"abacaba\". But in the candidate, the positions4-10 are \"abacaba\". But what about positions 0-6? The candidate is \"abazaba...\". So the first four characters are 'a', 'b', 'a', 'z' followed by 'a', 'b', 'a'. So the substring from 0-6 is \"abazaba\", which is not the target. So the only occurrence is at i=4. So this would be a valid solution. But in the sample output, the solution is \"abadabacaba\".

       "<p>Wait, perhaps in this test case, the code finds another i where the candidate works. Let me think. The sample input is 11, the string is \"aba?abacaba\". So length 11. The correct i is 3. Let's see:</p>\n",

       "<p>Hmm. Maybe the code tries i=5? Let's see. i=5 would be positions5-11, but the string is length 11, so 5+6=11, which is index 10. So positions5-10.</p>\n",
       "<p>Target is 'abacaba' → positions5: 'a', 6: 'b', 7: 'a', 8: 'c', 9: 'a', 10: 'b', 11: 'a'. Wait no, the target is 7 characters, so for i=5, the positions are 5,6,7,8,9,10,11? But n=11, indices up to 10. So i can be from 0 to 4 (since 4+6=10). So for n=11, i can be 0,1,2,3,4.</p>\n",

       "<p>Indices 3-9: d a b a c a b → no.</p>\n",
       "<p>Indices4-10: a b a c a b a → yes, this is 'abacaba' starting at index4 (positions4-10). Wait, the substring from 4 to 10 is 'a c a b a'? Let me recheck:</p>\n",
       "<p>positions4 is 'a', 5 'b', 6 'a', 7 'c', 8 'a', 9 'b', 10 'a'. Wait, no. positions4-10 would be 'a','b','a','c','a','b','a' → which is 'abacaba'. So in the candidate string, \"abadabacaba\", the substring starts at index4. So in the original string, how was this possible?</p>\n",
       "<p>The original string was \"aba?abacaba\". So when i=4, the code would replace positions4-10 (which are a, b, a, c, a, b, a) with \"abacaba\"? Wait, that's the same as the original. So the existing characters for i=4 are a, b, a, c, a, b, a. So the target is a, b, a, c, a, b, a. So those characters match. So in this case, the code would create the candidate string by replacing the '?' in position3 (the original s[3] is '?') with 'd' (assuming that other '?'s are replaced with 'z's, but in the sample solution, the '?' is replaced with 'd').</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but according to the code's algorithm, when i=4 is chosen, then the candidate replaces positions4-10 with 'abacaba', and replaces other '?'s (position3) with 'z'. So the candidate would have 'z' at position3, making the string 'abaZabacaba', but the sample output has 'abadabacaba'. So this suggests that the code's approach may not handle some cases.</p>\n",
       "<p>Ah, perhaps the algorithm is to replace the '?' in the target's positions (i to i+6) with the target's characters, and other '?'s with 'z's. So in the original string's third position (index3) is a '?', which is outside of the i=4's positions (positions4-10). So the code would replace it with 'z', leading to the candidate string's third position being 'z'. But in the sample output, it's 'd'. So there's a discrepancy here, which implies that the code may not generate the sample output, but the problem allows any correct output.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but the problem states that if there are multiple possible strings, output any. So the sample output is one possible solution, but the code's candidate may generate a different one. But how does the sample output achieve exactly one occurrence?</p>\n",
       "<p>In the sample output \"abadabacaba\", the occurrence is at position4. The rest of the string:</p>\n",

       "<p>Indices4-10: 'a','b','a','c','a','b','a' → exactly one occurrence.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the code's approach would need to generate such a candidate. But according to the algorithm, the code would replace the '?' at position3 with 'z' (when i=4 is chosen), leading to 'abaZabacaba', which would have exactly one occurrence. So why does the sample output have 'd'?</p>\n",
       "<p>Ah, because the code's algorithm may not generate that particular solution. But the problem allows any valid string. So perhaps the sample solution was generated by replacing the other '?'s with 'd's instead of 'z's. But the code's algorithm replaces them with 'z's, which is allowed. </p>\n",
       "<p>But wait, the code's algorithm would not generate the sample solution's string in that case. So perhaps the code's approach misses some valid i's. </p>\n",

       "<p>Hmm, perhaps the code's algorithm is correct, but the sample solution is just one of the possible valid outputs. Let's see:</p>\n",
       "<p>Original test case 3's input is 11, s=aba?abacaba. The code's approach would check each i from 0 to 4 (since 11-7=4).</p>\n",
       "<p>For i=0:</p>\n",
       "<p>Check positions0-6. The original s is:</p>\n",

       "<p>For i=0, the target is placed in positions0-6. So replace pos3 (the '?') with 'c' (target[3]). Then, other '?'s are replaced with 'z's, but in this case, the original string has no other '?', so the candidate string is \"abacaba c a b a\" → \"abacabacaba\".</p>\n",
       "<p>Now, check how many times \"abacaba\" appears in this candidate. The substring starts at i=0: \"abacaba\". Also, check if there's another occurrence. For example, positions4-10: \"abacaba\" → \"abacaba\" starts at position4. So the candidate would have two occurrences. So this i=0 is invalid.</p>\n",
       "<p>Ah, right. So in this case, the code would check the candidate and find that it has two occurrences, so it's invalid. Thus, i=0 is rejected.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the code would proceed to check i=4. Let's see:</p>\n",
       "<p>i=4. The positions4-10 need to be \"abacaba\". The original s has positions4-10 as 'a','b','a','c','a','b','a'. So this matches the target exactly. So the candidate string would replace these positions with 'abacaba' (same as original), and replace the '?' at pos3 with 'z'. So the candidate string becomes \"abazabacaba\".</p>\n",
       "<p>Check how many occurrences of \"abacaba\" are in this candidate. The substring starts at i=4 (positions4-10) → one occurrence. Are there any others? Let's see:</p>\n",
       "<p>Check positions0-6: \"abazaba\" → not a match. So no. So the count is 1. So this candidate is valid, and the code would return \"Yes\" and this candidate. But the sample output for this test case is \"abadabacaba\". Which has the occurrence at i=4 (positions4-10) and the '?' at pos3 replaced with 'd'.</p>\n",
       "<p>But according to the code's algorithm, the '?' at pos3 is replaced with 'z', leading to a valid candidate. So why does the sample output have 'd'? Because the code's algorithm allows any replacement of the other '?'s, as long as the final string has exactly one occurrence. </p>\n",
       "<p>So the code's approach would find the candidate where the '?' is replaced with 'z' and that's a valid solution. So why the sample output has 'd'? Because the code's approach may have found another i that leads to the 'd' being replaced. </p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, maybe the code's approach is not considering all possible replacements of the other '?', but the problem allows any replacement as long as the count is exactly one. So the code's approach may generate a different valid string than the sample, but it's still correct. </p>\n",
       "<p>Thus, the code's approach is correct. </p>\n",

       "<p>Another possible i is i=3:</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, n is 11, i ranges from 0 to 4 (since 11-7=4). So i=3 is allowed.</p>\n",

       "<p>Original s:</p>\n",
       "<p>positions3 is '?', positions4-9 are 'a','b','a','c','a','b'.</p>\n",
       "<p>Target's characters for j=0 to 6 are:</p>\n",

       "<p>So for i=3:</p>\n",

       "<p>position4: target[1] = 'b' → original is 'a' → mismatch. So this i=3 is invalid.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the code skips i=3.</p>\n",
       "<p>What about i=1?</p>\n",
       "<p>For i=1, the target is positions1-7. Let's check the existing characters:</p>\n",
       "<p>positions1: 'b' (target[0] is 'a') → mismatch. So i=1 is invalid.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the code would only find i=4 as valid.</p>\n",
       "<p>In that case, the candidate string would have pos3 replaced with 'z', leading to \"abazabacaba\". Checking this string for occurrences:</p>\n",
       "<p>The substring starts at i=4 (positions4-10) is \"abacaba\". Any other occurrences?</p>\n",
       "<p>Check all k from 0 to 4 (since len is 11):</p>\n",
       "<p>k=0: a b a z a → no.</p>\n",

       "<p>k=2: a z a a b → no.</p>\n",
       "<p>k=3: z a a b a → no.</p>\n",
       "<p>k=4: a a b a c → no. Wait, positions4-10 are 'a','b','a','c','a','b','a' → \"abacaba\". So count is 1. So the code's candidate would be valid. So the code outputs this candidate. </p>\n",
       "<p>But the sample output has 'd' at position3. Why? Because perhaps the code finds another i where the candidate is valid. But according to the analysis, there's only i=4. </p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, perhaps the code is considering other positions. But according to the code's logic, the only valid i is i=4. So why does the sample output have 'd'?</p>\n",
       "<p>Ah, perhaps the code's approach is generating a different valid candidate. For example, maybe there's another i where the code's candidate has exactly one occurrence. </p>\n",
       "<p>But in the sample input, the output is \"abadabacaba\". Let's check this string:</p>\n",
       "<p>Indices0: a, 1: b, 2: a, 3: d, 4: a, 5: b, 6: a, 7: c, 8: a, 9: b, 10: a.</p>\n",
       "<p>The substring from i=4 (positions4-10) is 'abacaba'. Are there any other occurrences? Let's check:</p>\n",
       "<p>k=0: 'abadaba' → no.</p>\n",
       "<p>k=1: 'badabac' → no.</p>\n",
       "<p>k=2: 'adabaca' → no.</p>\n",
       "<p>k=3: 'dabacab' → no.</p>\n",
       "<p>k=4: 'abacaba' → yes. </p>\n",
       "<p>So the count is 1. Thus, this string is valid. </p>\n",
       "<p>How was this string generated by the code? It must have been generated by replacing the '?' at position3 with 'd', but according to the code's algorithm, the only way to do that is if during the candidate creation, position3 is not part of the target's positions. For example, if the code chose to place the target at i=4, then position3 is outside, and if it's a '?', it's replaced with 'z'. But in the sample output, position3 is 'd', which implies that the code's algorithm would not have generated this. So perhaps there's another i where the code's candidate can generate this string.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, let's look at the sample output's string. The target is placed at i=4 (positions4-10). So during the candidate creation for i=4:</p>\n",
       "<p>position3 is outside the target's positions (i=4, positions4-10). So the candidate replaces position3 (which is '?') with 'z'. But in the sample output, it's 'd', which is not 'z'. </p>\n",
       "<p>This suggests that the sample output's solution is generated by a different approach than the code's algorithm. So why is the code's approach considered correct?</p>\n",
       "<p>Ah, because the code's algorithm only replaces non-target '?'s with 'z's. So the sample output's candidate is not generated by the code's algorithm, but the code's algorithm is correct because it's allowed to output any valid string. The code's candidate would be \"abazabacaba\", which is a valid solution. But the sample output uses a different valid string. </p>\n",
       "<p>So the code's algorithm is correct, but the sample output is generated in a different way. The code's output is allowed, but the sample shows another possibility. </p>\n",
       "<p>Thus, the code is correct. </p>\n",
       "<p>Another sample input is the sixth test case: 11 abacabacaba.</p>\n",
       "<p>The output is \"No\". Let's see:</p>\n",
       "<p>The code would check each i. For example, i=0:</p>\n",
       "<p>positions0-6: 'abacaba' → matches target. Then, other '?'s are replaced with 'z's. But in this case, the original string has no '?', so the candidate is the same as the original. The original string is \"abacabacaba\". Check for occurrences of \"abacaba\": at i=0 and i=4. So count is 2 → code would output \"No\".</p>\n",
       "<p>Thus, code works.</p>\n",
       "<p>Now, let's code this and test.\n",

       "Okay, let's see. I need to find two integers l and r such that the sum from l to r equals n. And I have to do this for multiple test cases. Hmm. Let's think about the mathematical formula here. The sum of consecutive integers from l to r is (r<em>(r+1)/2) - ((l-1)</em>l/2). That simplifies to (r + l) * (r - l + 1) / 2 = n. So, I need to find l and r that satisfy this equation.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, the problem says that any valid pair is acceptable. So maybe there's a pattern here. Let me look at the examples. For example, when n=1, the output is 0 1. So sum is 0+1=1. For n=2, the output is -1 2. The sum here is -1+0+1+2=2. Oh right, so that's a sum of 4 terms. For n=3, it's 1+2=3. So two terms.</p>\n",
       "<p>Hmm, maybe the approach is to find a sequence that can be represented as a sum of consecutive integers in a way that works for any n. Let's think about possible ways to represent n.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another observation: if n is a triangular number, then there's a simple solution. For example, 6 is a triangular number (1+2+3=6) so l=1, r=3. But in the example where n=25, the solution uses a negative l. So maybe considering negative numbers is key here.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, the problem allows l to be negative. So perhaps we can always find a sequence that starts with a negative number and includes enough terms to make the sum equal to n. But how?</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, maybe for any n, there exists a pair where the sequence has k terms. Let's think of k as the number of terms. So the sum is average * k = n. The average is (l + r)/2. Since the terms are consecutive, the average can be written as (l + r)/2, but since l and r are consecutive integers, the number of terms is (r - l + 1). Wait, no. Wait, the sum from l to r is (r-l+1) terms. For example, l=0, r=1: two terms. So the number of terms is r - l + 1. Let's call that k. Then the sum is k * (l + r) / 2 = n. So (l + r) * k = 2n.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the equation is (l + r) * k = 2n, and since l and r are consecutive, r = l + (k-1). Wait, no. If there are k terms, then r = l + (k-1). Because the sequence is l, l+1, ..., r. So r - l = k-1. So substituting r into the equation, (l + (l +k-1)) * k = 2n. Simplifying, (2l +k-1) <em>k = 2n. So 2n = k</em>(2l +k-1). Then solving for l: 2l +k-1 = 2n/k → 2l = (2n/k) -k +1 → l = (2n/k -k +1)/2.</p>\n",
       "<p>So l must be an integer. So for a given k, if 2n is divisible by k, then (2n/k -k +1) must be even. Otherwise, l would not be an integer. Wait, but l can be a non-integer only if the sum is an integer. Wait, but the sum is n, which is given as an integer. So perhaps for certain values of k, we can find l.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how do we choose k? Because for each possible k, which is a divisor of 2n, we can check if (2n/k -k +1) is even. If yes, then l is an integer, and then we can compute r = l +k-1.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the approach could be: iterate over possible divisors k of 2n, and check if (2n/k -k +1) is even. If yes, then compute l and r. Once we find such a k, we can output l and r.</p>\n",
       "<p>But 2n can be very large (up to 2e18), so iterating over all divisors is not feasible. So we need another approach.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, we can choose k as a divisor of 2n. But since 2n can be up to 2e18, finding all divisors is time-consuming. However, perhaps there's a way to choose k such that k is 2, and then see if it works. If not, try another k. Wait, but how do we find k efficiently?</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, let's think of k as any positive integer. The idea is that for each possible k, we can compute l and see if it's an integer. But trying all possible k's up to sqrt(2n) is not feasible for large n.</p>\n",
       "<p>But let's see. Let's take k=1. Then sum is l = n. Then r = l, but l &lt; r must hold, so k=1 is invalid. So k must be at least 2.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, in the sample input for n=1, k is 2 (terms 0 and 1). For n=2, k is 4 (terms -1,0,1,2). For n=3, k=2 (1 and 2). For n=6, k=3 (1,2,3). So the k varies. So perhaps k can be any even or odd divisor of 2n, but how to choose it efficiently.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another approach: note that the sum can be written as (k terms) times average. Let's think of k as the number of terms. The average is (l + r)/2. Since the terms are consecutive, the average must be either an integer (if k is even) or a half-integer (if k is odd). Wait, no. For example, if k is even, the average can be a half-integer. Let's take k=2: terms 0 and 1. Average is 0.5, sum is 1. So for even k, the sum is (k/2) multiplied by an odd number. Wait, maybe not. Let's think.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, let's consider that for a given k, 2n must be divisible by k. Because (l + r) *k = 2n. So k must divide 2n. So k is a divisor of 2n.</p>\n",
       "<p>But 2n can be up to 2e18, and finding all divisors of that is impossible for large t. So perhaps we need to find a k that is a divisor of 2n, but we can choose k to be 2 or some other small number.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but how can we find such a k efficiently?</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, let's see if we can choose k=2. Then 2n must be divisible by 2, which is true for even n. Wait, 2n is always even, so 2 divides 2n. So k=2 is possible. Then 2n /k = n. So substituting into the equation for l:</p>\n",
       "<p>l = (n -k +1)/2. Since k=2, l = (n-2+1)/2 = (n-1)/2. Then r = l +k-1 = l+1. So sum from l to r is l + (l+1) = 2l+1. But according to the equation, this should equal n. So 2l+1 =n. Which gives l=(n-1)/2. So if (n-1) is even, which it is for n being odd. Wait, n can be even or odd. Wait, if n is even, then (n-1) is odd, so l would be (n-1)/2 which is a non-integer. So that's a problem.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but k=2 is a divisor of 2n. So when k=2, the condition is that (2n/k -k +1) must be even, so that l is integer. So 2n/k is n, and (n -2 +1) =n-1. So (n-1) must be even. So n must be odd. So when n is odd, choosing k=2 gives a valid solution. Then l = (n-1)/2, r = l+1. For example, n=3: l=1, r=2. Which works. For n=1: l=(1-1)/2=0, r=1. Which is the first sample.</p>\n",
       "<p>So for odd n, k=2 works. For even n, k=2 does not work, because (n-1) is even only if n is odd. So for even n, we need to choose a different k.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, let's take the sample where n=2, which is even. The output is -1 2. The sum here is 4 terms. So k=4. Let's check: 2n=4. k=4 divides 4. Then l = (4/4 -4 +1)/2 = (1 -3)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1. So r= -1 +4-1=2. So sum from -1 to 2 is 4 terms, sum is (-1+0+1+2) = 2. Which is correct.</p>\n",
       "<p>So for even n, perhaps we can choose k to be a divisor of 2n such that (2n/k -k +1) is even. For example, when n is even but not a multiple of 4, perhaps k=4.</p>\n",
       "<p>Hmm. Let's see another example. n=6, which is even. The sample output uses k=3. Let's see: k=3, 2n=12. 12/3=4. Then 4 -3 +1=2, which is even. So l= (4-3+1)/2=2/2=1. r=1+3-1=3. Sum 1+2+3=6. Correct.</p>\n",
       "<p>So when n is even, perhaps we can choose k as a divisor of 2n. Let's see for n=100. The sample output uses k=5. 2n=200. k=5 is a divisor. Then 200/5=40. 40 -5 +1 = 36. 36/2=18. So l=18, r=18+5-1=22. Sum is 18+19+20+21+22=100. Correct.</p>\n",
       "<p>So for even n, perhaps we can find a k that is a divisor of 2n, and such that (2n/k -k +1) is even. But how to find such k quickly.</p>\n",
       "<p>But for large n, how do we find such k efficiently? Trying all possible divisors is not feasible. So perhaps there's a pattern here.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another observation: For any n, we can represent it as a sum of consecutive integers in the following way. Let's consider that the sum of consecutive numbers from a to b is equal to n. Let me think of k as the number of terms, which can be even or odd. Then, the key is that k must divide 2n, and that (2n/k -k +1) must be even.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the steps could be:</p>\n",
       "<ol>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>For a given n, find a k that divides 2n and for which (2n/k -k +1) is even.</p>\n",

       "</ol>\n",
       "<p>But how to find such a k quickly.</p>\n",
       "<p>Let's think for even and odd n:</p>\n",
       "<p>Case 1: n is odd. Then 2n is even. Let's choose k=2, which is a divisor of 2n. Then 2n/k = n. Then (n -2 +1) = n-1. Since n is odd, n-1 is even, so (n-1)/2 is integer. So l=(n-1)/2, r=l+1. So this works. So for all odd n, we can output l=(n-1)/2 and r=l+1.</p>\n",
       "<p>Case 2: n is even. Then 2n is even. We need to find a k that divides 2n and (2n/k -k +1) is even. Let's see.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, when n is even, perhaps we can choose k as the largest odd divisor of 2n. Wait, 2n is 2^m * s where s is odd. Then the largest odd divisor is s. Let's see.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, 2n is even, so when written as 2^a * b, where b is odd. Then the largest odd divisor is b. So perhaps choosing k = b.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how?</p>\n",
       "<p>Let's take an example. n=2. Then 2n=4=2^2*1. So largest odd divisor is 1. Let's see k=1. Then (2n/k -k +1) = (4/1 -1 +1) =4. 4 is even. So l=4/2=2. r=2+1-1=2. But l must be less than r. So k=1 is invalid.</p>\n",
       "<p>Hmm. So maybe this approach doesn't work.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, let's find the smallest possible k that divides 2n and satisfies the condition. For even n, let's try k= (some even divisor) or find another approach.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, for even n, let's consider that 2n = 2^m * q, where q is odd. Then, perhaps we can choose k= q, which is the largest odd divisor. Then check if (2n/k -k +1) is even.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, 2n/k = (2^m * q) / q = 2^m. So 2n/k -k +1 = 2^m - q +1. Let's see for n=2: 2n=4=2^2*1. q=1. So 2^2 -1 +1=4, which is even. So yes. Then l=(4)/2=2, r=2+1-1=2. Which is invalid. So that's a problem. Hmm.</p>\n",
       "<p>But maybe for even n, we can choose k as 2q, where q is the largest odd divisor. Let's see. Let's take n=2. 2n=4. largest odd divisor is 1. So k=2*1=2. Then 2n/k =4/2=2. Then (2 - 2 +1)=1, which is odd. So l=(1)/2=0.5, which is not integer. So that's invalid.</p>\n",
       "<p>Hmm. Not working.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another approach: Let's consider that for even n, the problem can be solved by choosing k as the smallest possible even divisor. Wait, but how.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, let's think about the sum when k is even. Then the sum is (l + r)<em>k/2. Let's let k be even, say k=2m. Then the sum is m</em>(l + r). But l and r are such that r = l +2m-1. So sum is m*(2l +2m-1) = n. So 2l +2m-1 = n/m. Then 2l = (n/m) -2m +1. So l must be ( (n/m) -2m +1 ) / 2. For l to be integer, (n/m -2m +1) must be even. But since m is a divisor of n, perhaps n is even and m can be any divisor.</p>\n",
       "<p>But this seems complicated.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, perhaps for even n, we can represent n as a product of two integers with opposite parity. For example, n = a * b, where a is even and b is odd, or vice versa.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, for even n, the approach could be to find k such that k is an even divisor of 2n, but I'm not sure.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, perhaps for even n, the solution is to set l = (n-1)/2 - m and r = (n-1)/2 + m +1, but I'm not sure.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, let's think about the examples for even n:</p>\n",
       "<p>n=2: output is -1 2. The sum is 4 terms. So k=4. Let's check:</p>\n",
       "<p>k=4 divides 2n=4. Then 2n/k =1. Then (1 -4 +1) = -2. Divided by 2 gives l=-1. So yes.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another example: n=6. The solution uses k=3. 2n=12, which is divisible by 3. Then 12/3=4. (4-3+1) =2, even. So l=1, r=3.</p>\n",
       "<p>So for even n, choosing k as an odd divisor of 2n could work. Because 2n is even. So 2n = 2 * m, where m is n. So if m is even, then 2n is divisible by 4. So 2n's divisors can include even and odd numbers.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, when n is even, 2n is divisible by 4. For example, n=2: 2n=4. So 4's divisors are 1, 2,4. For n=6: 12's divisors include 3, which is odd.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, the idea is that for even n, 2n has at least one odd divisor. For example, for 2n=4, the odd divisor is 1. Then, for k=1, but that's invalid. So perhaps not.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but in the example of n=2, k=4 is even.</p>\n",
       "<p>So perhaps for even n, the correct k is a divisor of 2n such that (2n/k -k +1) is even. How can we find such a k?</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, let's note that for even n, if we can find an odd k that divides 2n, then (2n/k -k +1) is even. Because:</p>\n",
       "<p>Since k is odd, 2n/k is even (since 2n is even and k is odd). So even minus odd (k) plus 1 gives even minus even. For example, even (2n/k) minus (k-1) which is even (since k is odd, k-1 is even). So even minus even is even. So (2n/k -k +1) = even - even = even. So (2n/k -k +1) is even.</p>\n",
       "<p>So if k is an odd divisor of 2n, then (2n/k -k +1) is even. Therefore, for even n, we can choose k as any odd divisor of 2n greater than 1. Because when k is odd, then (2n/k -k +1) is even.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, for even n, 2n is even. Let's factor 2n into 2^a * b, where b is odd. Then, the divisors of 2n that are odd are exactly the divisors of b. So for example, if 2n=24=2^3 *3, then the odd divisors are 1,3.</p>\n",
       "<p>So for even n, the approach is:</p>\n",
       "<p>Find any odd divisor k of 2n that is greater than 1. Then compute l = (2n/k -k +1)/2. Then r = l +k-1.</p>\n",
       "<p>This works because k is odd, so (2n/k -k +1) is even, hence l is integer.</p>\n",
       "<p>So for example, n=2:</p>\n",
       "<p>2n=4. 4=2^2 *1. The only odd divisor is 1, but k=1 is not allowed (since then l and r would be the same). So this approach might not work here. But wait, the sample for n=2 uses k=4, which is even.</p>\n",
       "<p>So perhaps there's a different approach for even n. Let's reevaluate.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, perhaps the approach is to consider that when n is even, 2n can be written as 2^m * q, where q is odd. Then, we can choose k = q. Then, since q is odd, (2n/k) = 2^m. Then (2^m - q +1) must be even. Let's see: 2^m is even (since m &gt;=1), q is odd. So 2^m - q is even - odd = odd. Then odd +1 is even. So yes, (2^m -q +1) is even. Therefore, when k is set to q (the odd part of 2n), then l is integer.</p>\n",
       "<p>So let's try this for even n.</p>\n",
       "<p>Example: n=2. 2n=4=2^2*1. q=1. So k=1. Then l = (4/1 -1 +1)/2= (4)/2=2. r=2+1-1=2. But l must be less than r. So invalid. So k can't be 1. So this approach fails here.</p>\n",
       "<p>But the sample uses k=4. So perhaps for even n, we need to choose k as 2q, where q is the odd part of n. Let's see.</p>\n",
       "<p>n=2: 2n=4. q=1. So 2q=2. Then k=2. Let's check. 2n/k=4/2=2. Then (2 -2 +1)=1, which is odd. So (1) divided by 2 is 0.5, which is not integer. So invalid.</p>\n",
       "<p>Hmm. Another approach: For even n, perhaps we can factor 2n into k and (something else) such that k is even and the other term is even as well.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, think of 2n as a product of two even numbers. For example, 2n = 2 * n. Then, k=2, but that gives the same problem as before.</p>\n",
       "<p>Let's look for another pattern. Let's take the sample where n=2. The solution uses k=4. Let's compute:</p>\n",
       "<p>k=4 is even. So 2n=4. 4/4=1. (1 -4 +1) = -2. Divided by 2 gives l=-1. Which is valid.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how does k=4 fit into the previous approach? For n=2, 2n=4. The divisors of 4 are 1,2,4. For even k=2, 4/2=2. (2-2+1)=1, which is odd. So invalid. For even k=4, (1-4+1)= -2, which is even. So l=-1. So yes.</p>\n",
       "<p>So even k can also work. So the approach for even n could be: find any divisor k of 2n (even or odd) such that (2n/k -k +1) is even.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to find such k quickly.</p>\n",
       "<p>But given that n can be up to 1e18, enumerating all possible divisors is impossible. So perhaps there's a way to construct such a k.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, let's see for even n:</p>\n",
       "<p>If we can find a k that is even, such that (2n/k -k +1) is even, then l is integer.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, perhaps for even n, we can choose k as the smallest possible even divisor greater than 1.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, let's see for n=2: k=4. 4 is a divisor of 4, and even. (2n/k -k +1) = (4/4 -4 +1) =1-4+1= -2, even. So l=-1. So this works.</p>\n",
       "<p>But why choose k=4? How to find it.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternative approach:</p>\n",
       "<p>For even n, 2n can be written as 2^a * b, where b is odd.</p>\n",
       "<p>If we take k=2^a, then:</p>\n",
       "<p>2n/k = (2^a * b)/2^a = b. So (b -k +1) = (b - 2^a +1). We need this to be even.</p>\n",
       "<p>But since b is odd and 2^a is even (since a &gt;=1), then b - even is odd. Then odd +1 is even. So (b -k +1) is even. So this would work.</p>\n",
       "<p>So if k=2^a, then (2n/k -k +1) is even. Therefore, l is (b -k +1)/2. Then r=l +k-1.</p>\n",
       "<p>Let's check this for sample inputs.</p>\n",
       "<p>Sample n=2: 2n=4=2^2 *1. a=2, b=1. k=2^2=4.</p>\n",
       "<p>So l= (1 -4 +1)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1. r = -1 +4-1=2. Correct.</p>\n",
       "<p>Sample n=6: 2n=12=2^2 *3. a=2, b=3. k=4. Then 2n/k=3. (3-4+1)=0. l=0/2=0. r=0+3=3. Sum is 0+1+2+3=6. But sample uses l=1 and r=3. Hmm, but another solution exists. So this approach would generate a valid solution.</p>\n",
       "<p>But the sample uses k=3. Let's see. For k=3, 2n/k=4. (4-3+1)=2, even. So l=1. So 1,2,3 sum to 6. So both options are valid.</p>\n",
       "<p>So this approach would generate a solution for even n.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another example: n=100. 2n=200=2^3 <em>25. a=3, b=25. k=8. 200/8=25. (25-8+1)=18. 18/2=9. l=9. r=9+8-1=16. Sum is (9+16)</em>8/2=25*4=100. Which is correct. But the sample output uses l=18 and r=22, which is sum of 5 terms. So why? Because there are multiple solutions.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, using this approach, for even n, the solution is to take k=2^a where a is the exponent of 2 in the prime factorization of 2n. Then compute l and r accordingly.</p>\n",
       "<p>So for even n:</p>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>Factor 2n into 2^a * b, where b is odd.</p>\n",

       "</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<p>So this approach will always work for even n.</p>\n",

       "<p>Because according to the problem statement, any valid solution is acceptable. So the approach outputs a different solution but correct. So for n=25, the algorithm would output 12 13.

       "<p>Another sample input: n=100 (even). 2n=200=2^3<em>25. a=3, b=25. k=8. l=(25-8+1)/2=18/2=9. r=9+7=16. Sum is (9+16)</em>8/2 =25*4=100. But the sample output is 18 22. Which is sum of 5 terms. Both are correct.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the algorithm works for even and odd n.</p>\n",
       "<p>Thus, the plan is:</p>\n",
       "<p>For each test case:</p>\n",

       "<p>So to compute a and b, we can find the largest power of 2 that divides 2n, then set b = 2n / (2^a).</p>\n",

       "<p>But how to compute a efficiently.</p>\n",
       "<p>In Python, we can find the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of m.</p>\n",

       "<p>Wait, for example, m=4 (binary 100). The lowest set bit is 4. So a=log2(4) =2. So that's correct.</p>\n",
       "<p>So for m=200 (binary 11001000), the lowest set bit is 8 (binary 1000). log2(8)=3. So a=3.</p>\n",
       "<p>Yes. So the code can compute the exponent a as the number of times 2 divides m.</p>\n",

       "<p>a = log2(lowest_bit)</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to compute log2 in Python. Well, the easiest way is to use the bit_length function. For example, 8 in binary is 1000, which has a bit_length of 4. So log2(8) is 3. So a = (lowest_bit.bit_length() -1).</p>\n",
       "<p>Yes. So for a number x, which is a power of two, x.bit_length() -1 gives the exponent.</p>\n",

       "Okay, let's see. The problem is about coloring elements of a sorted array red or blue such that the ranges (max - min) of the red and blue elements are different, and there's at least one of each color. If it's not possible, we have to output NO. Otherwise, output YES and the coloring.</p>\n",
       "<p>Hmm. First, the array is sorted. That's probably important for figuring out the min and max ranges efficiently. Since the array is sorted, the min is the first element and the max is the last. But when we split into red and blue, each subset's min and max depend on which elements are in there.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but since the array is sorted, if we have a subset, its min is the first element in that subset (since sorted), and the max is the last. Wait, no. Because the subset's elements may not be contiguous. Oh right, but the original array is sorted. So for a subset, if you take elements from the array, their min would be the first element in the subset (when considered in the original array's order) and the max would be the last element in the subset. Wait, no. Because the subset can have elements spread out. For example, take elements at indices 0 and 2 in a sorted array. The min is the element at 0, the max is the element at 2.</p>\n",
       "<p>So for any subset, the min is the minimum of its elements, which is the first element in the subset when the array is sorted. Wait, no. Because the subset can consist of elements that are not contiguous. For example, array [1, 3, 5]. A subset [3,5] has min 3 and max 5. Another subset [1,5] has min 1 and max 5. But the array is sorted, so the subset's elements are in the same order as the array. So the min is the smallest element in the subset (the first one in the subset's order if the subset is non-empty and taken from the sorted array). So for a subset S of the array, the min is the smallest element in S, which is the same as the first element in S if S is contiguous. Wait, no. For example, the subset could be elements at positions 0 and 3 in [1,2,3,4]. The min is 1, which is the first element of the array. So the min of any subset is the first element in the subset's elements when the array is sorted, but the subset can have elements spread out, so the min would be the minimum of all elements in the subset, which in the sorted array is the first element in the subset's indices. Wait, no. For example, the subset could consist of the elements 2 and 1 from an unsorted array, but in our problem, the array is sorted. So any subset of the sorted array will have elements in increasing order. Wait, the array is sorted, but the subset isn't necessarily contiguous. So the elements in the subset are still ordered as per their positions in the array. So, for example, if the array is [1,3,5,7], and a subset is the first and third elements (1 and 5), then the subset's min is 1 and max is 5. So the min is the first element in the subset's positions, but the subset may not be contiguous.</p>\n",
       "<p>But since the array is sorted, the min of any subset is the minimum of all elements in that subset, which is the first element in the subset when considering the original array's order. Because the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. So, the subset's elements are in positions i_1, i_2, ..., i_k where i_1 &lt; i_2 &lt; ... &lt; i_k. So the min is a[i_1], and the max is a[i_k].</p>\n",
       "<p>Ah, right! So for any subset S of the array, the min is a[i] where i is the smallest index in S, and the max is a[j] where j is the largest index in S. Because the array is sorted. So when you split the array into red and blue, for each color group, the range is (max index element - min index element) in that group.</p>\n",
       "<p>That's a key insight. So the range for red is the (max red element) - (min red element) which is a[last_red_index] - a[first_red_index]. Similarly for blue.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the problem reduces to assigning colors such that the ranges computed this way are different, and there's at least one of each color.</p>\n",
       "<p>Now, how to find such an assignment.</p>\n",
       "<p>Possible approaches:</p>\n",
       "<p>We can try various colorings and check if they meet the conditions. But since n can be up to 50, trying all possible 2^50 colorings is impossible. So we need a smarter approach.</p>\n",
       "<p>Let's think about possible strategies.</p>\n",
       "<p>The problem requires that the ranges of red and blue are different. So, perhaps there's a way to split the elements such that one color's range is larger than the other. Or maybe there's a way to make one range include a certain element that the other doesn't, thereby changing their ranges.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another thought: since the array is sorted, the overall range is a[n-1] - a[0]. Let's think about the red and blue ranges.</p>\n",
       "<p>Suppose all elements except one are red. Then red's range is a[n-1] - a[0], and blue's is 0 (since only one element). So if the overall range is not zero, then this would work. But wait, if the overall range is zero, then all elements are the same. So in that case, all colorings will have both ranges zero, hence equal, so output is NO.</p>\n",
       "<p>So perhaps in cases where the overall array's range is zero, the answer is NO. Because any split would result in ranges that are zero for both (since all elements are the same). So in that case, the answer is NO.</p>\n",
       "<p>So first check: if all elements are the same, then it's impossible to split. Because any split into red and blue will have both ranges zero. So in that case, output NO.</p>\n",
       "<p>That's one scenario handled.</p>\n",
       "<p>But what if the array has some variation?</p>\n",
       "<p>Let's think about possible splits.</p>\n",
       "<p>For example, the sample input where n=3, elements [3,3,3], output is NO. Because all elements are same.</p>\n",
       "<p>So that's covered.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another case is when the array's elements are not all the same.</p>\n",
       "<p>In that case, perhaps we can split the array in such a way that one color has a larger range than the other.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, for example, in the first sample input:</p>\n",
       "<p>[1,1,2,2]</p>\n",
       "<p>The output is RBRR. Let's see:</p>\n",
       "<p>Red elements are positions 0, 2, 3 (assuming 0-based). So their range is 2-1=1 (since a[0]=1 and a[3]=2). Blue element is position 1 (value 1). So blue's range is 0.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the ranges are different. So this works.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another approach: perhaps assign all elements to red except one element. Then, check if that element's removal changes the overall range.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but when you remove an element, the red's range would be the original max minus original min if the removed element is not the min or max. For example, if you remove a middle element, the red's range is still a[n-1] - a[0]. But if you remove the min, then the red's min is the next element, so the range is a[n-1] - a[1]. Similarly, if you remove the max, the range becomes a[n-2] - a[0].</p>\n",
       "<p>So, perhaps we can assign all elements to red except one, and check if the blue (single element) has range 0, which would differ from the red's range (which would be a[n-1] - a[0] minus some value if the removed element is the min or max).</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, assign all elements to red except one, and see if the ranges are different.</p>\n",
       "<p>But in that case, red's range depends on which element is excluded.</p>\n",
       "<p>So let's consider possible ways to split into all but one elements red, and one blue.</p>\n",
       "<p>If we color all elements red except one element (blue), then:</p>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>The blue range is 0 (since it's a single element).</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>The red range is (max_red - min_red). Now, if the excluded element is not the min or max, then the red's max and min are the same as the original array's (a[n-1] - a[0]). So if the original array's range is not zero, then red's range is original range, which would be different from blue's 0. So in that case, this split is valid.</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<p>So if we can find an element that is not the min or the max, then coloring all elements red except that element (blue) would work. Because then red's range is the original range (since min and max are still present), which is non-zero, and blue's is 0. So their ranges are different.</p>\n",
       "<p>But if all elements except the min and max are the same as min and max, then this approach might not work.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, let's think of an example where all elements are either min or max.</p>\n",
       "<p>Like array [1,1,2,2]. The min is 1, max is 2. So any element is either min or max. So if we exclude one element, say the second 1, then red's min is 1 (still present in the first element), and max is 2, so range is 1. Blue's is 0. So that's valid.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the approach of making all elements red except one (blue) works here.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another example: array [1, 2, 3]. Original range is 2. If we exclude the middle element (2) and color it blue. Then red's range is 3-1=2, blue's is 0. So 2 != 0. So this works.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the approach is: color all elements red except one (blue). If the red's range (original range) is different from 0 (blue's range), then this works. But the original range is a[n-1] - a[0]. As long as the original range is non-zero, which it must be if the elements are not all the same (since it's sorted), then this works.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the strategy is: if there exists an element that is not the min or max, then color it blue and all others red. Then the red's range is original range (since min and max are present in red), which is non-zero, and blue's range is 0. So the ranges are different.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but wait. Suppose the array is [1,1,3,3]. The min is 1, max is 3. If I color the second element (1) as blue. Then red elements are 1,3,3. Their min is 1, max is 3. So range is 2. Blue's is 0. So 2 !=0, which is okay.</p>\n",
       "<p>But what if the array is [1,3,3,3]. Then, the original range is 2. If we color the second element (3) as blue, then red elements are 1,3,3. Their range is 3-1=2. Blue's range is 0. So 2 vs 0: different. So this works.</p>\n",
       "<p>But in this case, the element chosen is a max. So wait, if the element is a max, then red's max would be the next to last element. For example, array [1,2,3], and we color the last element (3) as blue. Then red's elements are [1,2], range 1. Blue's range 0. So 1 !=0. That's valid.</p>\n",
       "<p>So even if the element we color blue is the min or max, as long as there are other min or max elements, then the red's min and max may still be present. So the red's range could still be the same as the original, but blue's is zero.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, let's see. For example, array [1,1,2,2]. Original range is 1. Suppose we color the first element (1, which is min) as blue. Then red elements are 1, 2, 2. Their min is 1 (the second element), max is 2. So range is 1. Blue's range is 0. So 1 vs 0: different. So valid.</p>\n",
       "<p>So even if the excluded element is a min or max, as long as there are other elements with that value, the red's range remains the same. So this approach works.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the key is: if there are at least two elements with min and two elements with max, then even if we exclude one min or one max, the other min or max is still present in red. So the red's range is original.</p>\n",
       "<p>But if the array has only one min or only one max, then excluding that element would change the red's range.</p>\n",
       "<p>For example, array [1,2,3,4]. The min is 1 (only once), max is 4 (only once). If we color the min (1) as blue. Then red's min is 2, max is 4. Red's range is 2. Blue's is 0. So 2 !=0: valid.</p>\n",
       "<p>So even if the element is the only min or max, this approach can work.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the approach is to color all but one elements as red, and one as blue. If the original array's range is non-zero (which it is if not all elements are same), then the red's range is (original range if the excluded element is not the only min or only max), or (max_red - min_red) which could be different. But regardless, blue's range is zero, which is different from red's range (since original range is non-zero). So this would work.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, wait. Let's suppose the array is [1,3,5]. The original range is 4. If I color 3 as blue. Then red elements are [1,5]. Their range is 4. Blue's is 0. So 4 !=0: valid.</p>\n",
       "<p>If I color 1 as blue. Then red's elements are [3,5], range 2. Blue's 0. 2 !=0: valid.</p>\n",
       "<p>If I color 5 as blue. Then red's elements are [1,3], range 2. Blue's 0. Valid.</p>\n",
       "<p>So in all cases, the red's range is (original range minus 2 in the case when I removed a min or max, but in the example above, when original range is 4, and after excluding min, red's range is 2, which is different from 0). So as long as the original range is non-zero, any split where all but one are red and one is blue would work.</p>\n",
       "<p>But wait, in the original example where the array is [3,3,3], all elements are same, so any split will have both ranges zero, so impossible.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the conclusion is: for any array that is not all elements the same, we can choose to color one element blue and others red. Then the red's range is (a[last] - a[0]) if the blue element is not the only min or max, but even if it is, the red's range may be different from zero.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but in the case where the array is [1,2,4]. Original range is 3. If I color 2 as blue. Then red's elements are [1,4]. Range is 3. Blue's is 0. So 3 !=0: valid.</p>\n",
       "<p>If I color 4 as blue. Then red's elements are [1,2]. Range is 1. Blue's is 0: valid.</p>\n",
       "<p>So in all cases, this approach works. So the only time this approach fails is when all elements are same. Because then, the red's range would be zero (since all elements are same except one), and blue's is zero. So same ranges.</p>\n",
       "<p>Therefore, the strategy is:</p>\n",
       "<p>For each test case:</p>\n",
       "<ol>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>Check if all elements are the same. If yes, output NO.</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>Otherwise, find any element that is not the first or last (but perhaps even if it is, but there are other elements of the same value). Wait, no. Wait, if the array is [1,1,2,2], then the first element is 1 (min), last is 2 (max). So elements in the middle could be 1 or 2. If we color a middle element (say the second 1) as blue, then red's range is 2-1=1 (since there are other 1s and 2s). So it's okay.</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "</ol>\n",
       "<p>But the key is that there exists at least one element that, when colored blue, leaves the red's range different from blue's. Which, for any array with non-zero range, this is possible by coloring any element as blue and others as red.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but what if the array is [1,2,2], which is sorted. Original range is 1. If we color the 1 as blue, then red's elements are [2,2], range 0. Blue's range is 0. So this is invalid. So in this case, the approach of coloring one element blue and others red would not work.</p>\n",
       "<p>So in this case, the array is [1,2,2]. The original range is 1. If I color the 1 as blue, then red's range is 2-2=0, same as blue's (0). So invalid. So the approach of coloring one element as blue and others as red would fail here.</p>\n",
       "<p>So this suggests that the initial approach is not sufficient.</p>\n",
       "<p>Hmm. So the problem arises when coloring the only min (or only max) as blue. Because then, the red's range could be zero (if all remaining elements are the same). But in that case, the red's range is zero and blue's is zero. So invalid.</p>\n",
       "<p>So for example, the array [1,2,2]. The min is 1 (only once). Max is 2 (twice).</p>\n",
       "<p>If we color 1 as blue, then red's elements are [2,2], range 0. Blue's range 0. So same ranges. So invalid.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the approach of coloring any element as blue and others as red may fail if the element colored is the only occurrence of min or max and the remaining elements are all the same.</p>\n",
       "<p>So what's another approach?</p>\n",
       "<p>We need to find a coloring where the ranges are different. Let's think of other possible colorings.</p>\n",
       "<p>In the example [1,2,2], how can we split?</p>\n",
       "<p>We need to have at least one red and one blue.</p>\n",
       "<p>Let's try:</p>\n",
       "<p>Color the first element (1) as red, the second and third (2,2) as blue. Then red's range is 0 (since only 1), blue's is 0. Not good.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another split: color the first and second elements as red, third as blue. Red's elements are [1,2], range 1. Blue's is 2, range 0. So 1 vs 0: valid. So this works.</p>\n",
       "<p>So output would be RRB.</p>\n",
       "<p>So how can this split be found?</p>\n",
       "<p>In this case, the red elements are [1,2], their min is 1, max is 2. So range 1. Blue is 2, range 0. Different.</p>\n",
       "<p>So in this case, the approach is to split into two groups where one group has more than one element and a different range.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, perhaps the initial approach is not sufficient. So what's the alternative?</p>\n",
       "<p>Another possible approach is to find a split where:</p>\n",
       "<p>Either:</p>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>The red group's range is different from the blue group's range.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<p>But how to find such a split efficiently.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another possible strategy: check if the first and second elements can be colored differently.</p>\n",
       "<p>For example, in the array [1,2,2], color the first as B, others as R. Then blue's range is 0. Red's is 2-2=0. So same. Not good.</p>\n",
       "<p>But if color first as R, second as R, third as B. Then red's elements are 1,2. Range 1. Blue's 2. So 1 vs 0: valid.</p>\n",
       "<p>So perhaps the approach is to assign as many elements as possible to red, but not all, and make sure that the red group includes the first element (min) and the last element (max), so their range is the original range. Then the blue group's range must be something else.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but in the case where the array is [1,2,2], the original range is 1. If red group includes the first and last elements (1 and 2), then their range is 1. Then the blue group can be the middle element (2). Then blue's range is 0. So 1 vs 0: valid.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the strategy here is to have the red group include the min and max of the entire array, and the blue group has elements in between. Then the red's range is the original range, and the blue's range is (max_blue - min_blue), which could be less than the original range.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to ensure that the blue group's range is different from the red group's.</p>\n",
       "<p>But if the red group's range is original range (non-zero), and the blue group's range is something else, then they are different. So, for example, if the blue group has a range that is less than the original range, then they are different.</p>\n",

       "<p>Wait, but the blue's range could be equal to the original range. For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3,4], and the blue group is [2,3], then their range is 1, but the original range is 3. So different. So that's okay.</p>\n",

       "<p>Color all elements red except for one element. Then check if the red's range is different from blue's. If yes, output. If not, find another split.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to handle cases where the initial approach may fail.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, let's consider the array [1,2,2]. The possible splits where one element is blue:</p>\n",
       "<p>Case 1: blue is 1 (min, only occurrence). Then red's elements are 2 and 2. Range 0. Blue's is 0. So same: invalid.</p>\n",
       "<p>Case 2: blue is 2 (first occurrence). Then red's elements are 1 and 2. Range 1. Blue's is 0: different. Valid.</p>\n",
       "<p>Case 3: blue is 2 (second occurrence). Same as case 2: red's range 1, blue's 0. Valid.</p>\n",
       "<p>So in this case, if we choose any of the 2's as blue, then the split is valid.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the approach could be: try to color a non-min and non-max element as blue. If that's not possible, then check for other possibilities.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, how to find such an element.</p>\n",
       "<p>The idea is:</p>\n",
       "<p>If the array has elements other than the min and max (i.e., elements a[i] where a[i] is strictly between a[0] and a[n-1]), then coloring one of them as blue and others as red will work. Because the red's range is a[n-1] - a[0], which is non-zero, and blue's is 0.</p>\n",
       "<p>But if all elements are either min or max (like in the array [1,1,2,2], where all elements are min or max), then there are no elements strictly in between. So in that case, when we color a min or max element as blue, what's the result.</p>\n",
       "<p>For example, array [1,1,2,2]. If we color a 1 (min) as blue. Then red's elements are 1,2,2. Range is 2-1=1. Blue's is 0. So different: valid.</p>\n",
       "<p>So even if the element is a min or max, as long as there are other elements of the same value, the split works.</p>\n",

       "<p>Sample Output for this case is YES BBRBB. Which indicates that the third element (3) is colored R. Wait, no.

But no, in this case, the array is 1,2,3,4,5. The code in step 2a would find elements 2,3,4 as being between 1 and 5. So any of them can be colored B. For example, choosing index 2 (3) as B. Then the coloring would be R R B R R → RRBRR. But the sample output is BBRBB. Hmm, this indicates that in the sample input, the third element (3) is colored R, and others are B. Wait, the sample output for this case is YES BBRBB. Wait, the array is [1,2,3,4,5]. The coloring is B B R B B. So the third element is R. The red elements are [3], blue elements are [1,2,4,5]. Red's range is 0. Blue's range is 5-1=4. So different. So the code would not generate this coloring, but the code would generate a coloring where one of the elements 2,3,4 is blue. For example, if code chooses element 3 (index 2) as B. Then the string is R R B R R. So red's range is 5-1=4 (since all elements are in red except 3). Blue's range is 0. So 4 vs 0. So that's valid.

       "Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem statement is a bit complex. Let's parse it carefully.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, we have n pictures. Each has a weight w_i. When Nauuo visits the website, one picture is displayed with probability proportional to its weight. Then, after each visit, if she likes the picture (a_i is 1), we add 1 to its weight; else subtract 1. We need to compute the expected weights after m visits. Then output each as a modulo inverse under 998244353.</p>\n",
       "<p>Constraints: n can be up to 2e5, m up to 3000. Oh right, the m is manageable with O(m^2) per test case? Because 3e3 squared is 9e6, which is acceptable.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but with n up to 2e5, we can't process each element for each step in O(n) time. That would be 2e5 * 3e3 = 6e8 operations, which might be too slow. So we need a way to model the expected values without per-element O(1) operations each step.</p>\n",
       "<p>Hmm, let's think about the process. For each visit, the probability of selecting each picture depends on their current weights. But the process is dynamic; each step affects the next probabilities.</p>\n",
       "<p>But since m is up to 3000, perhaps we can model the expected values using some dynamic programming approach that tracks certain parameters, and updates them efficiently each step.</p>\n",
       "<p>Let me think about the variables involved. Let's denote the expected value of the weight of picture i after k steps as E_i(k). We need to compute E_i(m) for all i.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how do the steps affect these expectations? Each step, a picture is selected based on the current weights (which are random variables themselves). Then, the selected picture's weight is adjusted by +1 or -1 based on a_i.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but the problem requires that after each visit, the weight is updated. So each step's selection is dependent on the current state, which includes all previous modifications.</p>\n",
       "<p>This seems tricky because each step's selection probability depends on the current sum of weights, which is changing over time. However, since m is up to 3000, perhaps we can model the expectations in a way that accumulates the necessary terms without tracking all possible states.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another idea: the expected change for each picture can be modeled using linearity of expectation and dynamic programming. Let's see.</p>\n",
       "<p>Let's denote S(k) as the sum of all weights at step k. Then, the probability of selecting picture j at step k is E(w_j(k)) / E(S(k)), where E(S(k)) is the sum of all E_i(k). Wait, but this is only valid if the events are independent, which they might not be. However, perhaps due to linearity of expectation, we can model the expectations correctly.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, the expectation of the weight after each step is influenced by whether the picture was selected in that step. Let's model this step by step.</p>\n",
       "<p>At each step k (from 0 to m-1), the current expected weights are E_i(k). Then, during step k+1:</p>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>We select a picture j with probability proportional to E(w_j(k)) / sum_E(k), where sum_E(k) is the sum of all E_i(k). But wait, actually, the selection probability is based on the actual current weights, which are variables. However, when taking expectations, perhaps the expected value of the selection is the expectation of the probability. Hmm, this might be a point where linearity of expectation is applied.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, perhaps during each step, the expected change to each picture's weight can be calculated by considering the probability that it was selected, multiplied by the change (either +1 or -1 based on a_i).</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, no. Because when a picture is selected, it's modified (either +1 or -1). So for each step, the weight of the selected picture changes by 1 (if a_j is 1, add 1, else subtract 1). The other pictures' weights remain the same.</p>\n",
       "<p>Therefore, the expected value of E_i(k+1) is equal to E_i(k) plus the probability that picture i was selected in step k+1 multiplied by (a_i * 1 + (1 - a_i)<em>(-1)), i.e., a_i</em>2 -1. Because if a_i is 1, then when selected, we add 1, so delta is +1. If a_i is 0, subtract 1, delta is -1. So delta is (2a_i -1) when selected.</p>\n",
       "<p>But wait, the selection happens based on the current weights at step k. So the probability that j is selected at step k+1 is E(w_j(k)) / sum_E(k), assuming that sum_E(k) is the sum of all E_i(k) at step k. Because in expectation, the sum of the weights is sum_E(k), and the selection probability for j is proportional to its expected weight.</p>\n",
       "<p>But is this correct? Because the actual selection probability depends on the actual weights, which are random variables. But the expectation of the selection probability is the expectation of (w_j / sum_w), where sum_w is the sum of all weights. However, this is not the same as E(w_j)/E(sum_w) unless the variables are independent or something. But maybe in this problem, given the way the steps proceed, the expected value can be approximated by this approach. Or perhaps this is a valid approach due to linearity.</p>\n",
       "<p>This seems like a possible approach. Let's try to model it.</p>\n",
       "<p>Let me define for each step, the variables E_i(k) as the expected weight of picture i after k steps. Then, the sum_S(k) = sum(E_i(k)).</p>\n",
       "<p>At each step, when we process the (k+1)th visit:</p>\n",
       "<p>For each picture i, the probability that it was selected in this step is E_i(k) / sum_S(k). Then, after selection, its weight is updated by (2a_i -1). So the expected change to E_i(k+1) is:</p>\n",
       "<p>E_i(k+1) = E_i(k) + (probability that i is selected) * (2a_i -1) + sum_{j≠i} (probability that j is selected) * 0.</p>\n",
       "<p>But since for each j, the selection of j affects j's weight, and other pictures are not affected. Wait, no: if j is selected, then j's weight changes. So for each j, when j is selected, j's weight increases by (2a_j -1). So for all i, E_i(k+1) is equal to E_i(k) + (probability that j=i was selected) * (2a_i -1). Because when j is selected, only j's weight changes.</p>\n",
       "<p>So for each step, the expected value for i is:</p>\n",
       "<p>E_i(k+1) = E_i(k) + (E_i(k) / sum_S(k)) * (2a_i -1) * 1. Because in expectation, the contribution to E_i(k+1) is the probability that i is selected multiplied by the delta (2a_i -1).</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but if i is selected, then its weight increases by (2a_i -1). So the delta is exactly (2a_i -1) if selected, 0 otherwise. So the expectation of the delta is (prob of being selected) * (2a_i -1). Therefore, yes, E_i(k+1) = E_i(k) + (prob of being selected) * (2a_i -1).</p>\n",
       "<p>But the prob of being selected at step k+1 is E_i(k) / sum_S(k), because sum_S(k) is the sum of all E_i(k) (since each E_i(k) is the expected weight of i after k steps). So the sum of the weights' expected values is sum_S(k) = sum(E_i(k)).</p>\n",
       "<p>Therefore, the recurrence is:</p>\n",
       "<p>E_i(k+1) = E_i(k) + (E_i(k) / sum_S(k)) * (2a_i - 1) * 1.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but this seems like a linear recurrence. But sum_S(k) is also changing each step. Because sum_S(k+1) = sum_S(k) + sum over j of (prob j is selected) * (2a_j - 1).</p>\n",
       "<p>But (2a_j -1) is 1 if a_j is 1, -1 otherwise. So sum_S(k+1) = sum_S(k) + sum_j ( (E_j(k)/sum_S(k)) * (2a_j -1) )</p>\n",
       "<p>Hmm, that's interesting. Let's compute sum_S(k):</p>\n",
       "<p>sum_S(k+1) = sum_i [ E_i(k+1) ] </p>\n",
       "<p>= sum_i [ E_i(k) + (E_i(k)/sum_S(k)) * (2a_i -1) ) ]</p>\n",
       "<p>= sum_E(k) + sum_i [ (E_i(k) * (2a_i -1)) / sum_S(k) ) ]</p>\n",
       "<p>= sum_S(k) + (sum_i [ E_i(k)*(2a_i -1) ]) / sum_S(k)</p>\n",
       "<p>But sum_i [ E_i(k)<em>(2a_i -1) ] is sum over all i of (2a_i -1)</em>E_i(k). Let's call this term T(k). Then sum_S(k+1) = sum_S(k) + T(k)/sum_S(k).</p>\n",
       "<p>So sum_S(k+1) can be tracked as sum_S(k) + T(k)/sum_S(k).</p>\n",
       "<p>But T(k) = sum_i (2a_i -1)*E_i(k) = sum_i [ (if a_i is 1, then 1, else -1) * E_i(k) ]</p>\n",
       "<p>Which can also be written as sum_i ( a_i * 2 -1 ) * E_i(k) = sum_i ( (2a_i -1) ) * E_i(k).</p>\n",
       "<p>So, during each step, we can compute T(k) as this sum.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, the problem reduces to tracking E_i(k) for each i and sum_S(k) for each step.</p>\n",
       "<p>But with n up to 2e5 and m up to 3e3, we need a way to compute this efficiently.</p>\n",
       "<p>But considering that for each step, to compute E_i(k+1) for all i, we need to compute for each i the term (E_i(k) / sum_S(k)) * (2a_i -1), which can be done as a multiplicative factor per i.</p>\n",
       "<p>But sum_S(k) is the same for all i in a particular step. So, for each step, we can precompute 1/sum_S(k), then multiply each E_i(k) by (1 + (2a_i -1)/sum_S(k)).</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, because E_i(k+1) = E_i(k) * (1 + (2a_i -1)/sum_S(k)) ). Because:</p>\n",
       "<p>E_i(k+1) = E_i(k) + E_i(k) * (2a_i -1) / sum_S(k) )</p>\n",
       "<p>= E_i(k) * (1 + (2a_i -1)/sum_S(k) )</p>\n",
       "<p>Yes. So this is a multiplicative update for each i based on a_i.</p>\n",
       "<p>This is a crucial insight. Because each E_i(k) is multiplied by a factor that depends on a_i and the current sum_S(k).</p>\n",
       "<p>So, for each step, the update for E_i(k) can be expressed as:</p>\n",
       "<p>E_i(k+1) = E_i(k) * (1 + (2a_i -1) / sum_S(k) )</p>\n",
       "<p>Similarly, sum_S(k+1) = sum_S(k) + T(k)/sum_S(k), where T(k) = sum( (2a_i -1) * E_i(k) )</p>\n",
       "<p>But T(k) can be rewritten as sum( (2a_i -1) * E_i(k) ) = sum( (2a_i -1) * E_i(k) ), which is the same as sum( (2a_i) * E_i(k) ) - sum( E_i(k) )</p>\n",
       "<p>But sum( E_i(k) ) is sum_S(k). So T(k) = 2 * sum( a_i * E_i(k) ) - sum_S(k)</p>\n",
       "<p>But sum( a_i * E_i(k) ) is the sum of E_i(k) for all i where a_i is 1. Let's call this sum_L(k). So sum_L(k) = sum( a_i * E_i(k) )</p>\n",
       "<p>Then T(k) = 2 sum_L(k) - sum_S(k)</p>\n",
       "<p>But sum_S(k) = sum_L(k) + sum( (1 - a_i) * E_i(k) ), since for a_i=0, (1 - a_i) is 1, and for a_i=1, it's 0.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, sum_S(k) = sum_L(k) + sum_U(k), where sum_U(k) is the sum of E_i(k) for a_i=0.</p>\n",
       "<p>So T(k) = 2 sum_L(k) - (sum_L(k) + sum_U(k)) ) = sum_L(k) - sum_U(k)</p>\n",
       "<p>Which is the same as sum( (a_i * 1) * E_i(k) ) - sum( (1 - a_i) * E_i(k) ) = sum( [a_i - (1 - a_i)] * E_i(k) ) = sum( (2a_i -1)*E_i(k) ), which matches the original definition.</p>\n",
       "<p>But perhaps tracking sum_L(k) and sum_U(k) could be useful. Because sum_L(k) is sum of E_i(k) for a_i=1, and sum_U(k) is sum for a_i=0.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how?</p>\n",
       "<p>Let's see: during each step, when we compute the new E_i(k+1), for each i, it's E_i(k) multiplied by (1 + (2a_i -1)/sum_S(k) )</p>\n",
       "<p>So for a_i=1, the factor is 1 + (1)/sum_S(k) = 1 + 1/S.</p>\n",
       "<p>For a_i=0, the factor is 1 - 1/S.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, for each step, the sum_L(k+1) is sum over a_i=1 of (E_i(k) * (1 + 1/S) ), which is (sum_L(k)) * (1 + 1/S )</p>\n",
       "<p>Similarly, sum_U(k+1) is sum over a_i=0 of (E_i(k) * (1 - 1/S) ), which is (sum_U(k)) * (1 - 1/S )</p>\n",
       "<p>So sum_L(k+1) = sum_L(k) * (1 + 1/S )</p>\n",
       "<p>sum_U(k+1) = sum_U(k) * (1 - 1/S )</p>\n",
       "<p>Where S is sum_S(k) = sum_L(k) + sum_U(k )</p>\n",
       "<p>This is a crucial observation. Because sum_L and sum_U can be tracked separately, and their updates are multiplicative factors based on the current sum_S.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, if we track sum_L and sum_U for each step, and for each step, compute the new sum_L and sum_U based on the current S, then we can compute all the required values without tracking each individual E_i(k).</p>\n",
       "<p>Because the E_i(k) for a_i=1 are all multiplied by (1 + 1/S) each step, and those for a_i=0 are multiplied by (1 - 1/S). So the sum_L and sum_U can be tracked as products of these factors over time.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, this is possible because for all a_i=1, their E_i(k) are multiplied by the same factor each step, and similarly for a_i=0. So the sum of their E_i(k) can be tracked as sum_L and sum_U, which each have their own multiplicative factors.</p>\n",
       "<p>If this is true, then the problem can be solved by tracking sum_L and sum_U for each step, and for each i, compute the product of their respective factors over all steps. Then, the final E_i(m) is the initial w_i multiplied by the product of factors for their a_i.</p>\n",
       "<p>This would reduce the problem's time complexity to O(m), regardless of n, which is feasible for m up to 3e3.</p>\n",
       "<p>Let me check this logic again.</p>\n",
       "<p>At step k, for a_i=1:</p>\n",
       "<p>E_i(k) = w_i * product_{t=0 to k-1} (1 + 1/S(t) )</p>\n",
       "<p>Similarly, for a_i=0:</p>\n",
       "<p>E_i(k) = w_i * product_{t=0 to k-1} (1 - 1/S(t) )</p>\n",
       "<p>Because each step, the factor for a_i=1 is (1 + 1/S(t)), and for a_i=0 it's (1 - 1/S(t)).</p>\n",
       "<p>So sum_L(k) = sum (w_i for a_i=1) * product_{t=0 to k-1} (1 + 1/S(t) )</p>\n",
       "<p>sum_U(k) = sum (w_i for a_i=0) * product_{t=0 to k-1} (1 - 1/S(t) )</p>\n",
       "<p>sum_S(k) = sum_L(k) + sum_U(k)</p>\n",
       "<p>So, the idea is to precompute for all steps t, the factors (1 + 1/S(t)) and (1 - 1/S(t)), then compute the product for each a_i type (0 or 1), multiply by the initial sum of their weights, and then compute sum_L and sum_U step by step.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how do we compute S(t) for each step?</p>\n",
       "<p>S(t) is sum_L(t) + sum_U(t), which depends on the product of factors up to t-1.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, the steps are:</p>\n",
       "<p>Initialize sum_L_0 = sum of w_i where a_i=1.</p>\n",
       "<p>sum_U_0 = sum of w_i where a_i=0.</p>\n",
       "<p>S_0 = sum_L_0 + sum_U_0.</p>\n",
       "<p>For each step from 0 to m-1:</p>\n",
       "<p>Compute factor_L = (1 + 1/S(t)) </p>\n",
       "<p>factor_U = (1 - 1/S(t))</p>\n",
       "<p>sum_L_{t+1} = sum_L_t * factor_L </p>\n",
       "<p>sum_U_{t+1} = sum_U_t * factor_U </p>\n",
       "<p>S_{t+1} = sum_L_{t+1} + sum_U_{t+1}</p>\n",
       "<p>So, after m steps, sum_L_m is sum_L_0 multiplied by the product of (1 + 1/S(t)) for each t in 0..m-1.</p>\n",
       "<p>Similarly for sum_U_m.</p>\n",
       "<p>Then, for each picture i:</p>\n",
       "<p>if a_i is 1:</p>\n",
       "<p>E_i(m) = w_i * product_{t=0 to m-1} (1 + 1/S(t) )</p>\n",

       "<p>E_i(m) = w_i * product_{t=0 to m-1} (1 - 1/S(t) )</p>\n",
       "<p>So, all pictures with a_i=1 have their expected values as their initial weight multiplied by the same product (product_L), and similarly for a_i=0 (product_U).</p>\n",
       "<p>So, the solution is:</p>\n",
       "<ol>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>Compute sum_L and sum_U initially.</p>\n",

       "</li>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>For each step, track the product_L and product_U. Wait no. Because for each step, the factors are applied to the sum_L and sum_U. So for the initial sum_L_0, after m steps, sum_L_m is sum_L_0 * product_L, where product_L is the product of (1 + 1/S(t)) for t from 0 to m-1.</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "</ol>\n",
       "<p>Similarly for sum_U_m = sum_U_0 * product_U.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, during each step, we can track the product_L and product_U. Then, for each i:</p>\n",
       "<p>if a_i is 1: the expected value is w_i * product_L.</p>\n",
       "<p>if a_i is 0: w_i * product_U.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how do we compute product_L and product_U?</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, product_L is the product of (1 + 1/S(t)) for each step t in 0 to m-1.</p>\n",
       "<p>But S(t) is sum_L(t) + sum_U(t), which depends on the previous steps.</p>\n",
       "<p>So during the simulation of each step, we can track S(t) and compute the products.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, the steps would be:</p>\n",
       "<p>Initialize sum_L = sum of w_i where a_i=1.</p>\n",
       "<p>sum_U = sum of w_i where a_i=0.</p>\n",
       "<p>product_L = 1 (for zero steps), product_U = 1.</p>\n",
       "<p>But wait, for each step from 0 to m-1:</p>\n",
       "<p>At step t, S = sum_L + sum_U.</p>\n",
       "<p>Compute factor_L = (1 + 1/S )</p>\n",
       "<p>factor_U = (1 - 1/S )</p>\n",
       "<p>Then, for the next step:</p>\n",
       "<p>sum_L *= factor_L </p>\n",
       "<p>sum_U *= factor_U </p>\n",
       "<p>Also, track product_L and product_U as the product of factors up to each step. For example, after m steps, product_L is the product of all (1 + 1/S(t)) for t=0 to m-1.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but sum_L after m steps is sum_L_0 multiplied by product_L. So product_L is the product of (1 + 1/S(t)) for each step t=0 to m-1.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, during each step, we can compute the current factor_L and factor_U, multiply them into the product_L and product_U variables, and then update sum_L and sum_U.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, no. Because sum_L and sum_U are updated each step by multiplying by their respective factors. So product_L is the product of all factors for a_i=1 steps.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, here's the plan:</p>\n",
       "<p>Initialize sum_L0 = sum of w_i where a_i=1.</p>\n",
       "<p>sum_U0 = sum of w_i where a_i=0.</p>\n",
       "<p>product_L starts at 1 (for zero steps), but after m steps, it's the product of all (1 + 1/S(t)) for t in 0..m-1.</p>\n",
       "<p>product_U is similarly the product of (1 - 1/S(t)).</p>\n",
       "<p>So, for each step t in 0 to m-1:</p>\n",
       "<p>Compute S = sum_L + sum_U.</p>\n",
       "<p>Compute inv_S = 1 / S mod MOD (since all divisions are modulo 998244353).</p>\n",
       "<p>Then, factor_L = (1 + inv_S) mod MOD.</p>\n",
       "<p>factor_U = (1 - inv_S) mod MOD.</p>\n",
       "<p>Multiply product_L by factor_L mod MOD.</p>\n",
       "<p>Multiply product_U by factor_U mod MOD.</p>\n",
       "<p>Then, update sum_L = sum_L * factor_L mod MOD.</p>\n",
       "<p>sum_U = sum_U * factor_U mod MOD.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but no. Because sum_L and sum_U are being updated each step. So after each step, sum_L is sum_L_prev * factor_L, and sum_U is sum_U_prev * factor_U. So the product_L and product_U variables are not needed, because sum_L and sum_U already incorporate all the factors up to the current step.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but how do we compute the product_L and product_U for each individual element? Because for each picture i with a_i=1, the expected value after m steps is w_i multiplied by the product of (1 + 1/S(t)) for each step t. Similarly for a_i=0.</p>\n",
       "<p>But sum_L after m steps is sum_L_initial * product_L. Because sum_L starts as sum_L_initial, and each step multiplies by factor_L. So product_L is the product of all (1 + 1/S(t)) factors for each step. So, for all a_i=1, their expected value is w_i * product_L. Similarly for a_i=0, product_U.</p>\n",
       "<p>Yes! So the key insight is that the multiplicative factors for each a_i group are the same across all steps. So for all a_i=1 pictures, their expected value is their initial weight multiplied by product_L. For a_i=0, multiplied by product_U.</p>\n",
       "<p>So during the m steps, we can compute product_L and product_U as the product of (1 + 1/S(t)) and (1 - 1/S(t)) for each step t. Then, for each i, multiply their initial weight by product_L or product_U based on a_i.</p>\n",

       "<p>For each step in 0 to m-1:</p>\n",

       "<p>if a_i is 1: output (w_i * product_L) mod MOD.</p>\n",
       "<p>else: output (w_i * product_U) mod MOD.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but sum_L and sum_U are being updated each step. So during each step, S(t) is sum_L + sum_U, which is sum_L_prev * factor_L_prev + sum_U_prev * factor_U_prev.</p>\n",
       "<p>But why does sum_L and sum_U need to be tracked? Because the product_L and product_U variables are the product of factors for each step. So during each step, the product_L and product_U variables are built by multiplying the factors for that step, regardless of the sum_L and sum_U. So sum_L and sum_U are needed to compute S(t) for each step's factors, but the product_L and product_U variables are separate.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, no. Because the factors depend on S(t), which is sum_L + sum_U at step t. But in the code, during each step, we first compute S as sum_L + sum_U, then compute the factors (1 ± inv_S), multiply product_L and product_U by these factors, then update sum_L and sum_U by multiplying their current values by the factors.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but in the code:</p>\n",
       "<p>Initially, sum_L is sum_L_initial, sum_U is sum_U_initial.</p>\n",
       "<p>product_L starts as 1.</p>\n",
       "<p>product_U starts as 1.</p>\n",
       "<p>Then, for each step:</p>\n",
       "<p>current S is sum_L + sum_U.</p>\n",
       "<p>compute inv_S = 1 / S mod MOD.</p>\n",
       "<p>factor_L is 1 + inv_S.</p>\n",
       "<p>factor_U is 1 - inv_S.</p>\n",
       "<p>product_L = product_L * factor_L mod MOD.</p>\n",
       "<p>product_U = product_U * factor_U mod MOD.</p>\n",
       "<p>sum_L = sum_L * factor_L mod MOD.</p>\n",
       "<p>sum_U = sum_U * factor_U mod MOD.</p>\n",
       "<p>But after this, for the next step, the sum_L and sum_U have been updated. So the next S is sum_L + sum_U again.</p>\n",
       "<p>Yes. So product_L and product_U are the product of factors from all steps, and sum_L and sum_U are updated each step to track the current sum.</p>\n",
       "<p>But the product_L and product_U variables are what we need to compute the expected values for each picture.</p>\n",
       "<p>So this approach will have O(m) time for the steps, and O(n) time for processing the initial and final steps. Since m is up to 3e3, and n up to 2e5, this is acceptable.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the plan is:</p>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>Precompute sum_L_initial and sum_U_initial.</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>For m steps, compute S, inv_S, factors, and update product_L, product_U, sum_L, sum_U.</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>For each picture, multiply their initial w_i by product_L or product_U based on a_i, modulo 998244353.</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<p>But how to compute inv_S? Since MOD is a prime (998244353), we can compute the modular inverse of S using pow(S, MOD-2, MOD).</p>\n",
       "<p>But S can be zero? No, because the problem statement says that the initial sum of weights is at least 1 (since there is at least one a_i=1, and their weights are positive). Also, during steps, sum_L and sum_U are multiplied by factors that could lead to sum_S decreasing. Wait, but in the problem statement, there's a constraint that the sum of initial weights is at most 998244352 - m. Also, the process modifies weights by adding or subtracting 1 per step. So during the m steps, the sum can decrease, but the problem statement ensures that the initial sum is such that after all m steps, the sum remains non-negative. Wait, but how?</p>\n",
       "<p>The problem statement says that the sum of initial weights is &lt;= 998244352 - m. So after m steps, the sum can increase by up to m (if all steps add 1), but 998244352 - m + m = 998244352, which is allowed. But during steps, the sum could decrease. However, in the problem statement's input constraints, it's guaranteed that the initial sum is such that after m steps, all weights remain non-negative. Because the problem says \"It is guaranteed that the sum of all the initial weights does not exceed 998244352 -m.\"</p>\n",
       "<p>But when a_i=0 and the picture is selected, its weight decreases by 1. So during the steps, a picture's weight can become zero or even negative. But the problem says that the initial weight is at least 1. But during steps, a weight can go negative. However, the problem's note says that in the first example, after a step, the weight can be 1 (for a_i=0, subtract 1 from 2 to get 1). But wait, the initial w_i is 2, and after a step, it becomes 1. Then, for subsequent steps, it can become 0, then -1, etc. But how does that affect the probabilities? Because the weight is supposed to be non-negative. But the problem statement allows the weight to become negative. Hmm, but the problem says that the expected value may be negative, but we have to output it modulo 998244353.</p>\n",
       "<p>But in our approach, we are tracking expected values, which could be negative. However, the modulo operation takes care of that.</p>\n",
       "<p>But in the problem's sample input 1, after one visit, the first picture's weight is 1 (if selected) or 2 (if not). The expected value is (2/3)<em>1 + (1/3)</em>2 = 4/3. So the expected value is correct regardless of the actual possible weights.</p>\n",
       "<p>So our approach correctly models the expected value even if individual weights go negative. Because expectation is linear, and the process is modeled in terms of expected values, not actual possible outcomes.</p>\n",
       "<p>So back to the code.</p>\n",

       "<p>So the code works.</p>\n",
       "<p>So now, the code can be written as follows.</p>\n",
       "<p>We need to read the input, sum the initial sum_L and sum_U. Then process m steps, each time updating product_L and product_U, sum_L and sum_U.</p>\n",
       "<p>Then, for each i, multiply the initial w_i by product_L or product_U based on a_i.</p>\n",
       "<p>But since sum_L and sum_U can be large, but we compute everything mod 998244353.</p>\n",
       "<p>But note that during the steps, sum_L and sum_U can be 0. For example, in sample 2, sum_U_initial is 0. So during step 0, sum_U is multiplied by 0, so sum_U remains 0.</p>\n",
       "<p>But when sum_L and sum_U are 0, their sum would be 0, which would make S=0, leading to division by zero. But according to the problem constraints, the initial sum is &gt;=1, and during steps, the sum can't reach zero because:</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, the problem says that the initial sum of weights is such that after m steps, the sum doesn't exceed 998244352. But during steps, the sum can decrease. For example, if all steps are a_i=0, then sum_S would decrease by 1 each time. But the problem's input ensures that the initial sum is such that after m steps, the sum is still positive? Or does it not?</p>\n",
       "<p>The problem says: \"It is guaranteed that the sum of all the initial weights does not exceed 998244352 -m.\"</p>\n",
       "<p>But during steps, each step can add or subtract 1 to the sum. The sum after m steps could be sum_initial + (number of steps where a picture is liked) - (number of steps where a picture is disliked).</p>\n",
       "<p>But the problem's input constraint is that sum_initial + m &lt;= 998244352.</p>\n",
       "<p>But during steps, the sum can be sum_initial + (sum (delta for each step)). Each delta is either +1 or -1.</p>\n",
       "<p>But the problem statement allows sum_initial to be up to 998244352 -m, meaning that even if all steps add 1 (sum_initial + m &lt;= 998244352 -m + m = 998244352), which is allowed.</p>\n",
       "<p>But during steps, sum_S can become zero. But according to the code, the sum_L and sum_U are computed modulo MOD. So sum_S can be zero modulo MOD, but in reality, the actual sum could be MOD *k. However, this would not be possible given the constraints. But the problem statement does not guarantee that sum_S is non-zero at each step. So what happens if sum_S is zero mod MOD during a step?</p>\n",
       "<p>In such a case, inv_S would be zero's inverse, which is impossible. But according to the problem's input constraints, the initial sum is at least 1. But during steps, sum_S can reach zero modulo MOD.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to handle that? For example, if sum_S becomes MOD, then S mod MOD is 0, which would make inv_S undefined.</p>\n",
       "<p>But according to the problem's input constraints, the sum of initial weights is at least 1 (since there's at least one picture with a_i=1 and initial weight &gt;=1). However, during the steps, sum_S could be MOD, leading to S mod MOD being zero. This would cause a division by zero error in the code.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to handle this?</p>\n",
       "<p>The problem statement's input constraints say: \"the sum of all the initial weights does not exceed 998244352 -m\".</p>\n",
       "<p>But MOD is 998244353. So the initial sum plus m can be at most 998244352, so sum_initial + m &lt;= 998244352. So during steps, the sum can increase by m, but sum_initial + m is 998244352. So sum_S can never reach 998244353, which is MOD. So sum_S during all steps is at most 998244352. Which is MOD-1. So modulo MOD, sum_S is sum_S's actual value. So inv_S is the modular inverse of sum_S mod MOD, which is valid since sum_S is &gt;=1 and &lt; MOD.</p>\n",
       "<p>So during the code's steps, sum_S is always between 1 and MOD-1. Therefore, inv_S is always computable.</p>\n",

       "Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to find a line passing through a given query point that splits the convex polygon into two regions of equal area. If such a line exists, we need to output its polar angle; otherwise, -1. And we have to handle up to 1e5 queries efficiently after preprocessing the polygon. The polygon has up to 1e4 vertices, so any O(n) per query approach might be too slow. So, we need a way to process each query in logarithmic time or similar.</p>\n",
       "<p>First, let's understand the problem. For each query point P inside the polygon, we need a line through P that divides the polygon into two equal areas. Since the polygon is convex, maybe there's a way to find such a line using some geometric properties.</p>\n",
       "<p>I remember that for a convex polygon, any line through the centroid (or maybe the center of mass) divides the area into two equal parts. But here, the line must pass through the query point, not the centroid. So maybe the idea is that there's a certain direction such that when we rotate a line around P, the area on each side changes continuously. By the intermediate value theorem, there must be a direction where the area is exactly half. But wait, maybe for some points, such a line doesn't exist. Wait, the problem says to output -1 if it's impossible. But according to the problem statement, the polygon is strictly convex, and the query points are strictly inside, so I think that for any point inside, there exists exactly one such line (but maybe not, perhaps there are cases where multiple lines pass through P and split the area, but the problem allows any such line). Wait, but how can there be no such line? For example, if the polygon is a triangle and the point is the centroid, then any line through the centroid splits the area into two equal parts. But if the point is not the centroid, then there should be exactly one such line. Wait, no. For a triangle, any line through a point inside might not split the area equally. Wait, but in a convex polygon, maybe for any point inside, there exists exactly one line passing through it that splits the area into two equal parts. That would mean that the answer is always possible. But the problem allows outputting -1. So maybe the problem allows for cases where the point is such that no line through it can split the area into two equal parts. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, the problem says \"determine that it's impossible\". So the answer is possible for some points but not others. But how? For example, take a square. The centroid is the center. Any line through the center splits the area. But if a point is not the center, say slightly off, then there might be a line through it that splits the area. So perhaps for any point inside a convex polygon, there exists exactly one line through it that splits the area. So why would there be cases where it's impossible? Hmm. Maybe in cases where the polygon has symmetry. Wait, perhaps in the case where the query point is such that all possible lines through it cannot split the area. But I can't think of such a scenario. So maybe the answer is always possible, and the -1 case is never needed. But the problem includes the possibility, so perhaps there are cases where the line passes through the point but the areas are not equal. But perhaps not.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, perhaps when the polygon is such that the query point is on the only line that can split the area (like the centroid), but when you have to have the line pass through that point, but there's no other line. But that's the same as before. Hmm. Well, perhaps the answer is always possible. But the problem's examples include outputs where the answer is possible, but maybe in some other cases, it's not. So we need to handle that.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to approach this problem?</p>\n",
       "<p>Let's think: for a given point P, we need to find a line passing through P such that the area on both sides is equal. So the line divides the polygon into two parts, each with area equal to half of the total area.</p>\n",
       "<p>The key idea here is that for a convex polygon, the set of lines passing through P that split the area into two parts is a continuous function. So, as we rotate the line around P, the area on one side increases while the other decreases. By the intermediate value theorem, there must be a position where the area is exactly half. Therefore, for any point inside the convex polygon, there is at least one such line. So the answer is always possible, and we can always output a line. So why does the problem mention outputting -1? Maybe I'm missing something here. Wait, perhaps the line must pass through P and also be a chord of the polygon, i.e., the line must enter and exit the polygon. If P is inside the polygon, then any line through P will intersect the polygon's boundary in two points (since it's convex). So the line will split the polygon into two parts. Therefore, for any point inside the polygon, there exists at least one line through it that splits the area. Therefore, the answer is never -1. But the problem allows for -1. Hmm. Maybe the problem's test cases include impossible situations, but according to this reasoning, perhaps not. But maybe there's a mistake in the reasoning. For example, if the polygon has an even number of sides and symmetry, maybe a line passes through P but the areas are not exactly equal. But according to the problem's output condition, even a 1e-4 difference is allowed. So as long as the line can be found with sufficient precision, it's acceptable.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the conclusion is that the answer is always possible. Therefore, the -1 case is never required. But the problem allows for it, so perhaps we need to handle some edge cases. For example, maybe the polygon is such that when the line passes through P, the line is tangent to the polygon, but since the polygon is convex, any line through P would intersect the boundary at exactly two points. Therefore, the line is a chord. So the line will split the polygon into two parts, and the sum of their areas is the total area. So the problem is to find a line through P such that the two parts have equal areas. So the answer must exist.</p>\n",
       "<p>So how to compute this line?</p>\n",
       "<p>The approach would be: for each query point P, we need to find the direction (angle) of the line through P that splits the polygon into two equal areas.</p>\n",
       "<p>An efficient way to compute this for each query is needed, given that there are up to 1e5 queries and 1e4 vertices.</p>\n",
       "<p>The brute-force approach would be, for each query point, to compute the area for all possible lines through P, but that's impossible for large n and q.</p>\n",
       "<p>We need a smarter approach.</p>\n",
       "<p>Let me think about the convex polygon and a point P inside it. The line passing through P that divides the area into two equal parts must have the property that when you rotate the line around P by 180 degrees, the area on one side increases from S to total area, then decreases back. There must be a point where the area is exactly S/2. But how to compute this angle?</p>\n",
       "<p>This sounds like a problem that can be solved with a binary search on the angle. For each query point P, perform a binary search over the possible angles (from 0 to pi), compute the area of one part, and check if it's equal to half the total area. But how to compute the area for a given angle quickly?</p>\n",
       "<p>The key is that for a given line through P (determined by an angle theta), we can split the polygon into two parts. The area of each part can be computed by finding the intersection points of the line with the polygon's edges, then forming the two polygons and calculating their areas.</p>\n",
       "<p>But for a convex polygon, the line through P will intersect exactly two edges. So for each direction theta, the line is determined, and we can find where it cuts the polygon. Then, compute the area of the two resulting parts.</p>\n",
       "<p>However, calculating this for each query and each angle in a binary search would be O(n) per query, which is 1e5 * 1e4 * log (precision steps) operations. That's 1e9 operations, which is way too slow for the time limit.</p>\n",
       "<p>So we need a more efficient approach. Let's think about precomputing some information about the polygon that allows us to answer each query in O(log n) time.</p>\n",
       "<p>An alternative idea: For any line through P that splits the polygon into two equal areas, that line must pass through the centroid of the polygon. Wait, no. Because the centroid is the point where any line through it divides the area into two equal parts. But if the line must pass through P (which is not the centroid), then the line will not pass through the centroid. So this idea is not applicable.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another approach: The line that splits the area must be such that the sum of the moments (weighted by area) around P is zero. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, think of the polygon as a collection of triangles from P to each edge. But I'm not sure.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a rotational sweep. For a fixed point P, as we rotate the line around P, the area on one side varies continuously. The binary search approach could work if we can compute the area for a given direction quickly.</p>\n",
       "<p>So how can we compute the area for a given direction theta in O(1) or O(log n) time?</p>\n",
       "<p>Let's model the line through P as a direction theta. The line is at angle theta from the x-axis. For a given theta, the line can be represented in polar coordinates as passing through P with angle theta.</p>\n",
       "<p>The line will intersect the polygon in two points. Let's call them A and B. Then, the polygon is split into two parts: one part is the polygon formed by the points from A to B along the original polygon's edges, plus the line AB. The other part is the remaining points plus AB. The area of each part can be computed as the sum of the original polygon's area up to the split points and the area of the triangle or trapezoid formed by the line.</p>\n",
       "<p>But to find where the line intersects the polygon's edges, we need to find the two edges that are intersected by the line. Since the polygon is convex, the line through P (which is inside the polygon) will enter and exit the polygon, intersecting exactly two edges. So for each theta, the line will cross two edges. For each edge of the polygon, we can precompute something that allows us to find, for a given direction, which edges are intersected.</p>\n",
       "<p>But even this seems computationally intensive for each query.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another idea: For each query point P, the line that splits the area is the line that passes through P and the centroid of the polygon. Wait, no. Because the centroid is the average of all vertices, but that's not necessarily the case. The centroid (center of mass) of a polygon is the point where any line through it divides the area into two equal parts. So if P is the centroid, then any line through P will split the area. But if P is not the centroid, then there's exactly one line through P that splits the area. Wait, perhaps that's the case. So the line that passes through P and the centroid would split the area into two equal parts. But that's only true if the centroid is on the line. Wait, this is getting confusing.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, the centroid of a polygon is a point such that any line through it divides the polygon into two regions of equal area. So if the line passes through the centroid, then the areas are equal. But for a point P that is not the centroid, the line that splits the area must be such that the centroid lies on the line. Because otherwise, the sum of the moments around the line would not balance. Hmm, perhaps the line through P must pass through the centroid. So the line that splits the area must pass through both P and the centroid. If the centroid is not P, then the line is uniquely determined by P and the centroid. But wait, that can't be right. Because if P is not the centroid, then the line through P and the centroid would split the area equally. But in that case, for any other point P', the line through P' and the centroid would also split the area. But that would imply that for any query point P, the line through P and the centroid is the answer. But that's only true if the centroid is the center of the polygon's area. So perhaps the answer is the line passing through the query point and the centroid. But how can this be?</p>\n",
       "<p>Let me test this with the first example. The first example's input is a triangle with vertices (0,0), (0,3), (3,0). The query point is (1,1). The centroid of a triangle is the average of its vertices: ( (0+0+3)/3, (0+3+0)/3 ) = (1, 1). So the centroid is (1,1), which is the query point. Therefore, any line through this point would split the area. The output in the example is 2.677..., which is an angle. Let me see: the line in the example is probably the median of the triangle. Wait, but any line through the centroid would work. So the sample output could be any angle between 0 and pi, but the answer is correct as long as the line passes through (1,1). So why the sample output's angle is specific? Because the problem statement allows any valid angle. So maybe the code in the first example outputs the line that is the angle of one of the edges. Hmm. So in that case, the line could be any angle through (1,1), but the code returns a specific one, which is correct.</p>\n",
       "<p>But according to this reasoning, if the query point is the centroid, then any line through it is acceptable, and we can return any angle. But for a general query point that's not the centroid, the line must pass through the centroid. So how?</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, that would mean that the line through the centroid and the query point is the answer. So the solution is to compute the centroid of the polygon, then for each query point, compute the line passing through the query point and the centroid. If the query point is the centroid, then any angle is acceptable (but we have to pick one within [0, pi], perhaps the first possible). But this approach would be O(1) per query, which is feasible.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how accurate is this approach?</p>\n",
       "<p>Let's test this with a simple example. Suppose the polygon is a square with vertices (0,0), (0,2), (2,2), (2,0). The centroid (center of mass) is at (1,1). Suppose the query point is (0.5, 0.5). The line through (0.5,0.5) and (1,1) would have a slope of (0.5)/(0.5) = 1, so the angle is 45 degrees (pi/4 radians). This line would split the square into two equal areas. So that's correct.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another example: Take a rectangle with vertices (0,0), (0,4), (4,4), (4,0). Centroid is (2,2). Query point is (1,1). The line through (1,1) and (2,2) would have a slope of 1, angle pi/4. This line divides the rectangle into two equal areas. So this approach works.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another example: Take a triangle with vertices (0,0), (0,3), (3,0). Centroid is (1,1). If the query point is (0.5, 0.5), then the line through (0.5,0.5) and (1,1) would split the area. Let's compute the area. The line passes through (0.5,0.5) and (1,1), which is the same line y = x. The area of the triangle is 4.5 (since base and height are 3). So half is 2.25. The line y=x would split the triangle into two regions. The area of the part below the line can be calculated. Let's see: the line y=x intersects the triangle's edges. The original triangle has vertices at (0,0), (0,3), (3,0). The line y=x passes through (1.5, 1.5), which is the midpoint of the hypotenuse. Wait, in this case, the line would split the triangle into two equal parts. So the area is correct.</p>\n",
       "<p>But wait, the query point is (0.5,0.5), which is not the centroid (1,1). The line through (0.5,0.5) and (1,1) is y=x, which splits the area. So this works.</p>\n",
       "<p>Hmm, this seems to hold. So the key insight is that the line must pass through the centroid of the polygon. Therefore, for any query point P, the line that passes through P and the centroid will split the area into two equal parts. Therefore, the solution is to precompute the centroid of the polygon and for each query, compute the angle of the line passing through P and the centroid. If the query point is the centroid, then any line through it (any angle) is acceptable, but we can choose the angle that passes through another point, or perhaps return 0 in that case.</p>\n",
       "<p>But why is this the case? Because the centroid is the balance point of the polygon. So any line through the centroid splits the area into two equal parts. Therefore, if a line passes through the centroid and the query point, it must split the area. Thus, the answer is always possible, and the line is determined by the line passing through the query point and the centroid.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but the line passes through the centroid. So if the query point is not the centroid, then the line is uniquely determined. So for each query point, the line is the one that passes through P and the centroid. The angle is determined by the direction from P to the centroid, or vice versa. Wait, but the line is determined by two points: P and the centroid. So the direction of the line is the same as the direction from P to the centroid, but in the opposite direction as well. But the polar angle is measured from the OX axis. So the line's angle can be computed as the angle of the vector from P to the centroid, but since the line is bidirectional, the angle can be in [0, pi] by adding pi if necessary.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, for example, the line through P and the centroid has a direction. The polar angle is the angle of that direction. But since a line has two directions (opposite each other), the angle can be represented modulo pi. So the correct way is to compute the angle of the vector from P to the centroid, then take it modulo pi. For example, if the vector is pointing in theta radians, then theta can be in [0, 2pi), but the line's polar angle is either theta or theta - pi, whichever is in [0, pi].</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, since the line is the same as the line through the centroid and P, the direction from P to centroid is the same as the direction from centroid to P. The line's angle is the angle of the direction vector between these two points. But since the line can be oriented in two directions, the polar angle is in [0, pi].</p>\n",
       "<p>Therefore, the solution is:</p>\n",
       "<ol>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>Precompute the centroid of the polygon.</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",

       "<p>For each query point P:</p>\n",

       "</ol>\n",
       "<p>a. Compute the vector from P to the centroid (dx, dy).</p>\n",
       "<p>b. Compute the angle theta of this vector (using math.atan2(dy, dx)).</p>\n",
       "<p>c. If theta is negative, adjust it to be in [0, 2pi) by adding 2pi.</p>\n",
       "<p>d. Then, take theta modulo pi. Because the line can be represented by theta or theta - pi, whichever is in [0, pi].</p>\n",
       "<p>e. If the centroid is the same as P (dx and dy are zero), then any angle is acceptable, so output 0 (or any angle in [0, pi]).</p>\n",
       "<p>But wait, how do we compute the centroid of the polygon?</p>\n",
       "<p>The centroid (also known as the geometric center or center of mass) of a polygon can be computed using the formula:</p>\n",
       "<p>C_x = (1/(6A)) * sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (x_i + x_{i+1}) * (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i )</p>\n",

       "<p>where A is the area of the polygon, and the vertices are ordered in a closed loop (with vertex n being vertex 0).</p>\n",
       "<p>So first, we need to compute the area of the polygon and then compute the centroid.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the steps are:</p>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>Precompute the centroid (C_x, C_y) of the polygon.</p>\n",

       "<li>\n",
       "<p>If dx and dy are both zero (C is the same as P), then any angle is acceptable, so output 0.0 or any angle in [0, pi].</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>Otherwise, compute the angle theta = math.atan2(dy, dx).</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>Then, normalize theta to be in [0, pi]. Because the line can be represented in two directions (theta and theta + pi), but we have to pick the one in [0, pi].</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<p>For example:</p>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>If theta is between 0 and pi, keep it.</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>If theta is between pi and 2pi, subtract pi to get it into [0, pi].</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<p>Wait, no. For example, theta is 3pi/2 (270 degrees). The line can be represented as 3pi/2 or 3pi/2 - pi = pi/2. Which is in [0, pi].</p>\n",
       "<p>So the correct way is to compute the angle in [0, 2pi) and then take the remainder when divided by pi. But since the line is bidirectional, theta and theta + pi are the same line. So the polar angle is theta modulo pi.</p>\n",
       "<p>Therefore, the angle should be adjusted to lie within [0, pi]. For example:</p>\n",
       "<p>If theta is 3pi/4 (135 degrees), then it's already in [0, pi].</p>\n",
       "<p>If theta is 5pi/4 (225 degrees), subtract pi to get 5pi/4 - pi = pi/4 (45 degrees).</p>\n",

       "<p>3 vertices, then a query point (1,1). The centroid is (1,1), so the code would output 0.0. But the sample output is approximately 2.6779 radians. So why is there a discrepancy?</p>\n",
       "<p>Ah, because the code's approach is wrong. Oh no! So this suggests that the line through the centroid and the query point (which is the same as the centroid) is not the correct line. But wait, the line must pass through the centroid. But when the query point is the centroid, any line through it is acceptable. So why does the sample output show a particular angle?</p>\n",
       "<p>Ah, because the sample's query point is the centroid, so any angle is correct, and the sample's answer is one of the possible correct answers. So the code's approach is correct. So why does the sample output not have 0.0? Because any angle is acceptable. So the answer could be any angle in [0, pi]. So the code's approach of outputting 0.0 when the query point is the centroid would also be correct, but the sample's answer is a different angle. So the code's approach would pass the test.</p>\n",
       "<p>But the sample's output is a particular angle. How to compute that angle?</p>\n",
       "<p>In the first sample, the polygon is a right-angled triangle with vertices (0,0), (0,3), (3,0). The centroid is ( (0 + 0 + 3)/3, (0 +3 +0)/3 ) = (1,1). The query point is (1,1). So any line through (1,1) is acceptable. The sample's output is approximately 2.6779, which is 5pi/6 radians (since pi is about 3.14159, so 5pi/6 is around 2.61799). Wait, but 5pi/6 is approximately 2.61799, but the sample output is 2.6779. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, perhaps the line is not through the centroid? But no, the line must be through the centroid. So perhaps the sample's line is a different line, but it's also passing through the centroid.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the initial approach. Let's re-examine the problem.</p>\n",
       "<p>The initial assumption is that the line must pass through the centroid. But according to the first sample, the line passes through the centroid (since the query point is the centroid), but any line through it is acceptable. So the code's approach would return 0.0, but the sample's answer is different. So why is that?</p>\n",
       "<p>The code's approach for when the query point is the centroid is to output 0.0. But the sample's correct answer is another angle, which is also valid. So any angle is acceptable, and the code's approach would return any of them. So why does the sample output not match the code's approach? Because there are multiple correct answers, and the code's approach outputs any one of them. The problem allows any correct angle. So in that case, the code's approach is valid.</p>\n",
       "<p>Therefore, the code's approach is correct. So the code would precompute the centroid, and for each query, compute the line passing through the query point and the centroid, and return the angle of that line. If the query point is the centroid, then any angle is correct, so return 0.0 (or any other angle in [0, pi]).</p>\n",
       "<p>But wait, what if the line through P and the centroid is not a valid splitting line? For example, consider a convex polygon where the centroid is inside, but the line through P and the centroid doesn't split the area equally. But according to the initial reasoning, any line through the centroid splits the area equally. So why would that line not work?</p>\n",
       "<p>Ah, here's the key. The centroid is the point where any line through it splits the area into two equal parts. So the line through P and the centroid is a line through the centroid, hence it will split the area. But the line must also pass through P. So if P is not the centroid, then the line passes through both P and the centroid, which are two points. Therefore, this line will split the area into two equal parts. Therefore, the approach is correct.</p>\n",
       "<p>Thus, the solution is:</p>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>Compute the centroid of the polygon.</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",

       "<p>The angle of this vector (modulo pi) is the answer.</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<p>But let's verify this with the first sample.</p>\n",
       "<p>Sample 1:</p>\n",
       "<p>The query point is (1,1), which is the centroid. So dx and dy are zero. So the code can output any angle. The sample's output is 2.6779 radians, which is approximately 5pi/6 (2.61799). But there's a discrepancy. Oh, wait, perhaps the code is not outputting 0.0. But according to the problem statement, when the query point is the centroid, any angle is acceptable. So the code's approach of outputting 0.0 is correct. But the sample's answer is different. So why?</p>\n",
       "<p>Because the code's approach is not correct. Oh no! So there's a flaw in the initial reasoning.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, the initial reasoning assumes that any line through the centroid splits the area equally. But according to the first sample, the line through the centroid (and any angle) splits the area. So the code's approach is correct. But in the first sample, the output is a specific angle. So why is that the case? Because the code's approach would output 0.0 when the query point is the centroid, but the sample's answer is a different angle. So there's a problem here.</p>\n",
       "<p>This suggests that the initial approach is incorrect. So where is the mistake?</p>\n",
       "<p>Ah, here's the mistake: The centroid is the point where any line through it divides the area into two equal parts. Therefore, for any line through the centroid, including the line passing through the query point P (which is the centroid), the area is split equally. But when the query point is not the centroid, the line through P and the centroid is a line through the centroid, which splits the area equally. Therefore, this line is a valid answer.</p>\n",
       "<p>But wait, when P is not the centroid, the line passes through P and the centroid, which is a line through the centroid. Therefore, it's a valid line that splits the area.</p>\n",
       "<p>But when P is the centroid, then any line through P is acceptable.</p>\n",
       "<p>So why in the first sample, the code's approach would output 0.0, but the sample's answer is 5pi/6 (approx)? Because in the sample, the code's approach would return 0.0 when the query point is the centroid, but the sample's answer is a different angle. However, according to the problem statement, any angle in [0, pi] is acceptable. Therefore, both 0.0 and 5pi/6 are correct answers. The code's approach is correct.</p>\n",
       "<p>But why is the sample's output not 0.0? Because the correct answer is any angle, and the code's approach returns any of them. So the sample's answer is correct.</p>\n",
       "<p>But in reality, how does the line through the centroid and P split the area when P is not the centroid? For example, if P is some point inside the polygon, then the line passes through P and the centroid, which is a line through the centroid, thus splits the area. Therefore, the approach is correct.</p>\n",
       "<p>But why is this the case? Because the centroid is the point where any line through it divides the area. So even if the line also passes through P, which is another point, the line will split the area.</p>\n",
       "<p>Therefore, the code's approach is correct.</p>\n",
       "<p>Now, the next step is to compute the centroid of the polygon, and for each query, compute the angle from P to the centroid.</p>\n",
       "<p>Now, to implement this:</p>\n",
       "<p>First, compute the centroid.</p>\n",
       "<p>The formula for the centroid (Cx, Cy) is:</p>\n",
       "<p>Cx = (1/(6A)) * sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (x_i + x_{i+1}) * (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i )</p>\n",
       "<p>Cy = (1/(6A)) * sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (y_i + y_{i+1}) * (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i )</p>\n",
       "<p>where A is the area of the polygon.</p>\n",
       "<p>The vertices are given in clockwise order. Wait, but the area formula may return a negative value if the vertices are in clockwise order. So when computing A, we need to take the absolute value.</p>\n",
       "<p>Let's proceed.</p>\n",
       "<p>First, read the n vertices. Compute the sum for A, Cx, and Cy.</p>\n",
       "<p>But the area A is computed as (sum (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i )) / 2. But the sign depends on the order of the vertices. Since the polygon is given in clockwise order, the area would be negative, so we take the absolute value.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, for a polygon given in clockwise order, the area computed by the standard formula would be negative. So when calculating A, we take the absolute value and divide by 2.</p>\n",
       "<p>But for the centroid computation, the formula uses the sum terms, which may have a negative sign. But since we are multiplying by (x_i + x_{i+1}) and (y_i + y_{i+1}), the sign would cancel out when divided by A.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the code would compute:</p>\n",
       "<p>sum_area = 0</p>\n",
       "<p>sum_cx = 0</p>\n",

       "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where I have to pair up all the points in such a way that each pair is perfectly balanced. That means when I pair two points, there's no other remaining point inside their axis-aligned bounding box. And I have to output the order of these pairs.</p>\n",
       "<p>Hmm. Let's think about the approach here. The problem requires that for each pair (a, b) chosen, no other remaining point is inside their bounding box. But the order in which we remove pairs matters because once a pair is removed, those points are no longer considered when checking subsequent pairs.</p>\n",
       "<p>The key is to find a sequence of pairs that satisfies the condition step by step. But how?</p>\n",
       "<p>Let's think about the constraints. For each step, when selecting a pair, there shouldn't be any other point left in their bounding box. So maybe if we can find a pair that has a minimal bounding box, like adjacent points in some sorted order, then those pairs are less likely to contain other points.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, maybe sorting the points in some order and then pairing adjacent points could work. For example, if we sort all the points by their x-coordinate, then pair the first two, then the next two, etc. But wait, even after sorting, the first two's bounding box might include other points. Like if there's a point that's in the x range but has a higher y or z.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, maybe there's a way to process the points in a way that each pair we select is the \"closest\" in some sense. But how do we define closest here? Since the bounding box depends on all three coordinates.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another approach: think recursively. Find a pair that can be removed first, then remove them and repeat. The challenge is finding such a pair each time.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how do we find such a pair efficiently? Because if we check every possible pair each time, that's O(n^3) time (for each step, O(n^2) pairs to check, and O(n) steps), which for n=2000 would be 2000^3 = 8e10 operations—way too slow.</p>\n",
       "<p>So we need a smarter approach.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, maybe there's a way to process points in a certain order where pairs can be formed without having to check all possibilities. For example, if we sort the points by their coordinates and then pair them in a specific order such that their bounding boxes don't contain any other points.</p>\n",
       "<p>Let me think: suppose we sort all the points in some order, then pair them in consecutive pairs. For instance, sort by x, then y, then z. Then pair the first two, then the next two, etc. But would their bounding boxes not contain any other points?</p>\n",
       "<p>For example, in the first sample input, when sorted by x, perhaps the pairs would be in order. But I'm not sure. Let's look at the first example:</p>\n",
       "<p>The input is six points. The output pairs are (3,6), (5,1), (2,4). Let's see how they were formed. After pairing 3 and 6, their bounding box might be such that no other points were inside. Then, when those two are removed, pairing 5 and 1, etc.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, maybe the solution is to sort all points in some way and pair the first and last, then second and second last, etc. This would create pairs with the largest possible bounding boxes, but perhaps in a way that doesn't include others. Wait, but that might not be the case. For example, if you pair the first and last in a sorted list, their bounding box would encompass all the other points. So that's not good.</p>\n",
       "<p>Hmm. Wait, maybe the minimal approach is to pair points in such a way that their bounding boxes are as small as possible. So perhaps, for each point, find the closest point such that their bounding box contains no other points. But how to do this efficiently?</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, maybe the problem can be simplified by considering that any two points can form a pair as long as there's no other point whose coordinates lie between them in all three dimensions. Wait, no. Because the condition is that the other point must lie in all three dimensions' min-max ranges. So for a pair (a,b), a third point c is in their bounding box if and only if c's x is between a and b's x, and same for y and z.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the idea is that for the current pair (a,b), all other points must have at least one coordinate outside the min and max of a and b's corresponding coordinate.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, that's a good observation. So for a pair (a, b), any other point c (still present) must not lie in all three intervals. So, for each such c, either its x is outside [min(a.x, b.x), max(a.x, b.x)], or the y is outside, or the z is outside.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to find such pairs quickly?</p>\n",
       "<p>Another idea: process the points in a sorted order. Let's say we sort all the points in a certain order. Then, for each consecutive pair in this sorted order, check if their bounding box contains any other points. If not, pair them. If that's possible, then after removing them, the next pairs can be processed similarly.</p>\n",
       "<p>But this depends on the sorted order. For example, if we sort all points by x, then y, then z. Then, for consecutive pairs, the x-coordinates are adjacent. But their y and z might vary. So perhaps the first pair in the sorted list can be safely paired because their x is the smallest two, and perhaps no other points have x in their range. Wait, but other points could have x in the same range but larger than them. So their x is between the first two's x, but the y or z might be outside. Hmm, but that's not possible. Wait, the first two in the sorted x list have the smallest x. So their x ranges would be between the first two. Any other point would have x greater than or equal to the first two. Wait, no. Suppose we have sorted points in x order. Then the first two points have x values less than or equal to the rest. So their x range is between the two, which could be overlapping with other points. For example, if the first point has x=1, second x=3, and there's a third point with x=2. Then, the x of the third point is in the range of the first two. So their bounding box would include the third point's x. So that's a problem. So pairing the first two would not be allowed if there's a third point with x in between.</p>\n",
       "<p>So that approach might not work.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternative approach: Find two points such that their bounding box doesn't include any other points. How can we find such a pair efficiently?</p>\n",
       "<p>But for n=2000, checking all possible pairs for each step would be O(n^2) per step, which with n=2000 steps (since n/2 steps) is O(n^3) operations. That's 2000^3 = 8e10 operations, which is way too slow.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, we need a smarter way.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but maybe there's a way to always find a pair that can be removed first, and then proceed. For example, the pair that is the \"extremal\" in some dimension. Like, the pair with the minimal x-coordinate. Let's think: if there's a point with the minimal x and another with the next minimal x, then their x range is between those two. But other points may have x in that range. So that's not helpful.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, perhaps we can process the points in a certain order such that each step pairs two points that are the \"closest\" in all three coordinates, but that's not necessarily the case.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, think of it as a graph problem where each possible pair is a node, and edges represent that the pair can be safely removed. Then the problem is to find a perfect matching in this graph, but that's again computationally expensive.</p>\n",
       "<p>Hmm. Let's think of a way to construct the pairs in a way that avoids the need to check all possibilities.</p>\n",
       "<p>An alternative idea: For each point, find the first point (in some order) such that their bounding box does not contain any other points. Then pair them, and repeat.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to implement this efficiently.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, here's a possible approach. Sort all the points in a certain order (like by x, then y, then z). Then, pair each point with the next one in the sorted list. But how can this work?</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, let's think. If we sort the points in a certain order, perhaps the first pair in the sorted list can be safely removed. Then, the next pairs can be processed in the same way.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, let's take the first example. The input points are:</p>\n",
       "<p>1: (3,1,0)</p>\n",
       "<p>2: (0,3,0)</p>\n",
       "<p>3: (2,2,0)</p>\n",
       "<p>4: (1,0,0)</p>\n",
       "<p>5: (1,3,0)</p>\n",
       "<p>6: (0,1,0)</p>\n",
       "<p>If we sort them by x, then y, then z, the order might be:</p>\n",
       "<p>Point 6: (0,1,0)</p>\n",
       "<p>Point 2: (0,3,0)</p>\n",
       "<p>Point 4: (1,0,0)</p>\n",
       "<p>Point 5: (1,3,0)</p>\n",
       "<p>Point 3: (2,2,0)</p>\n",
       "<p>Point 1: (3,1,0)</p>\n",
       "<p>Now, the first pair could be 6 and 2. Their x is 0 and 0 (so min and max x is 0). So any other point's x is &gt;=0, but in this case, other points have x 1, 2, etc. So the x range is 0 to 0, so other points' x are not in this range. Therefore, the bounding box's x is fixed. So for the y coordinate, 6 has y=1, 2 has y=3. So the y range is 1 to 3. So other points like 4 (y=0) would be outside, 5 (y=3) is at the upper edge. Wait, 5's y is 3, which is within 1-3. So if there's a point c with x in [0,0], y in [1,3], z in [0,0], then it's inside the bounding box. But in this case, after pairing 6 and 2, are there any other points left in their box?</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, let's see. The other points are 4 (1,0,0), which x is 1 (outside 0-0). So it's outside. 5 (1,3,0): x is 1 (outside), so even though y is 3 (inside), z is 0 (inside), the x is outside. So the box for 6 and 2 is (0,0,0) to (0,3,0). So points not in this box must have x not 0. So 6 and 2 can be safely paired, because the other points have x &gt;=1. So their box doesn't contain any other points. So this pair is valid.</p>\n",
       "<p>Then, after removing 6 and 2, the remaining points are 4,5,3,1.</p>\n",
       "<p>So next, perhaps pair 4 and 5. Let's check their box. x is 1 and 1 (so min and max x is 1). So other points (3 and 1) have x=2 and 3, which are outside. So their x is outside. So even if their y and z are within, the x is outside. So the box of 4 and 5 is x=1, y ranges from 0 to 3, z=0. But the other points have x=2 and 3. So they are outside. So this pair is valid.</p>\n",
       "<p>Then, the remaining points are 3 and 1. Pair them. Their box is x 2 to 3, y 1 to 2, z 0. The other points are already removed, so this is valid.</p>\n",
       "<p>But in the first example's output, the first pair is 3 and 6. So perhaps the order of processing can vary.</p>\n",
       "<p>So maybe the approach is to sort the points and pair in a certain order, perhaps the first and the last, but how?</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to sort the points lexicographically (x, then y, then z) and then pair the first and second, third and fourth, etc. Let's see.</p>\n",
       "<p>In the first example, after sorting, the points are:</p>\n",
       "<p>6: (0,1,0)</p>\n",
       "<p>2: (0,3,0)</p>\n",
       "<p>4: (1,0,0)</p>\n",
       "<p>5: (1,3,0)</p>\n",
       "<p>3: (2,2,0)</p>\n",
       "<p>1: (3,1,0)</p>\n",
       "<p>Pairing consecutive pairs: 6 &amp; 2, 4 &amp;5, 3 &amp;1. Which matches the first sample's output? The sample output is:</p>\n",
       "<p>3 6</p>\n",
       "<p>5 1</p>\n",
       "<p>2 4</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, no. Because in the sample output, the first pair is 3 and 6. So perhaps the approach of pairing sorted order is not the same as the sample's approach.</p>\n",
       "<p>Hmm, but the sample's first pair is 3 and 6. Let's see their coordinates: 3 is (2,2,0), 6 is (0,1,0). The bounding box is x from 0 to 2, y from 1 to 2, z 0. Are there any other points in this box? The other points initially are 1,2,4,5. So point 1: (3,1,0) x is 3, which is outside. Point 2: (0,3,0), y is 3 which is outside. Point4: (1,0,0) y is 0 outside. Point5: (1,3,0) y is 3 outside. So the box for 3 and6 doesn't include any other points. So pairing them is allowed. Then, after they are removed, the remaining points are 1,2,4,5.</p>\n",
       "<p>So next pair is 5 and1. Let's see their coordinates: 5 is (1,3,0) and 1 is (3,1,0). The box is x 1-3, y 1-3. Are there any other points in this box? The remaining points are 2 (0,3,0) and 4 (1,0,0). For 2: x is 0 &lt;1, so outside. For 4: x is 1, which is in the x range, y is 0 &lt;1, so outside. So this pair is valid. Then, the remaining points are 2 and4, which can be paired.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the sample's output is correct. But this approach isn't the sorted consecutive pairs. So why does that work?</p>\n",
       "<p>Hmm, maybe the key is to find pairs that form a bounding box that is minimal in some sense, such that no other points are in their box. So perhaps, in the sorted list, if the first and second have a box that contains no others, pair them. Otherwise, look for another pair.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to find such pairs quickly.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, here's an alternative approach. For all pairs of points, the earliest possible pair to choose is the pair with the lexicographically smallest coordinates. But I'm not sure.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, think of the problem as a graph where each possible pair (i,j) is a node. But this is not helpful.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another idea: since the problem says that it's always possible to find such a sequence, perhaps there's a greedy way to pair points. For example, sort all points in some order and pair them in such a way that each consecutive pair doesn't have any other points in their box. But how?</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, the solution might be to sort all points in some way and pair the first and second, third and fourth, etc. But how to ensure that the pairs don't have any other points in their boxes.</p>\n",
       "<p>For example, if we sort the points lexicographically by x, then y, then z, then for each consecutive pair (points 1 and 2, 3 and4, etc.), check if their box contains any other points. If not, pair them. If there are, perhaps there's another way.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to efficiently check if the pair's box contains any other points. For each pair (a, b), the box is defined by min and max of x, y, z. For each other point c, we need to check if c's x is between min and max, y is between min and max, and z is between min and max.</p>\n",
       "<p>But for n=2000, checking all points for each pair is O(n) per pair, leading to O(n^3) total operations, which is not feasible.</p>\n",
       "<p>So this approach is not efficient.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternative approach: For each point, find the next point in the sorted list that can form a pair. But again, the check is expensive.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but perhaps there's a way to structure the data such that the pairs can be formed in a way that their boxes are minimal in some sense. For example, for each point, find the closest point in the sorted order such that their box is as small as possible.</p>\n",
       "<p>But I'm not sure.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved by sorting the points in any order and then pairing them such that each pair's box is such that no other points are left. Wait, but how? For example, if we sort the points in any order, then pair the first and second, then third and fourth, etc., but ensuring that each pair's box is empty.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to do this without checking all possibilities.</p>\n",
       "<p>Hmm. Let's think of the following approach:</p>\n",
       "<p>Sort all the points in a certain order, say lex order. Then, for each point in order, pair it with the next point in the list. But how to know if this pair is valid.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but perhaps after sorting, the first pair's box is such that all other points are either lex greater than the second point. So, their x is larger than the second point's x, so the box's x range is between the first and second points. But other points could have x in that range. For example, if the first two points have x=0 and 5, and the third point has x=3. Then the box of the first pair includes x from 0 to5. So the third point's x is inside. So the first pair can't be paired.</p>\n",
       "<p>But this approach doesn't work.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternative idea: Pair points in a way that their bounding box is as small as possible. For instance, pair each point with the next point in the sorted order (sorted by x, then y, then z). The thought is that consecutive points in the sorted list have similar coordinates, so their bounding boxes are small, and thus less likely to include other points.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to verify this.</p>\n",
       "<p>Let's take the first example. After sorting, the order is:</p>\n",
       "<p>6 (0,1,0)</p>\n",
       "<p>2 (0,3,0)</p>\n",
       "<p>4 (1,0,0)</p>\n",
       "<p>5 (1,3,0)</p>\n",
       "<p>3 (2,2,0)</p>\n",
       "<p>1 (3,1,0)</p>\n",
       "<p>If we pair consecutive pairs: 6&amp;2, 4&amp;5, 3&amp;1.</p>\n",
       "<p>Check if these pairs are valid.</p>\n",
       "<p>Pair 6 and 2: their x is 0 and 0, so x min and max are 0. So any other point's x must be 0, but the other points have x &gt;=1. So their x is outside. So the bounding box of 6 and 2 is x:0, y:1-3, z:0. So other points are 4 (x=1), which is outside. So this pair is valid.</p>\n",
       "<p>Then, next pair 4 and5. Their x is 1, so x min and max 1. Other points are 3 (x=2) and 1 (x=3). So their x is outside. So the box is x:1, y:0-3, z:0. So other points are outside. So valid.</p>\n",
       "<p>Then pair 3 and1. x ranges from 2 to3. Other points are already removed. So valid.</p>\n",
       "<p>So this approach works for the first sample.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another example: the second input.</p>\n",
       "<p>Input 8 points. Output is 4 pairs. The output pairs are 4&amp;5, 1&amp;6, 2&amp;7, 3&amp;8.</p>\n",
       "<p>In this case, after pairing 4 and5, then 1 and6, etc. How did they pair?</p>\n",
       "<p>But perhaps the approach is to sort the points lex order and pair consecutive pairs. Let's see.</p>\n",
       "<p>But perhaps the key is to sort the points in any order and pair them in a way that for each pair, their bounding box does not include any other points. But how to do that quickly.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, here's a crucial observation: if you sort all the points in any order (say, by x, then y, then z) and pair them as (1,2), (3,4), etc., then for each pair, there are no other points in their box. Why? Because when you pair consecutive points in the sorted order, any other point in the list would have a higher or lower x, y, z than the pair. But this may not be the case.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, after sorting, the pair (i, i+1) will have their x values ordered. The next points (i+2, etc.) may have x &gt;= the pair's max x. So their x is outside. Similarly, if two consecutive points in the sorted list have their x as the same, then other points may have x equal to that, but perhaps higher y or z.</p>\n",
       "<p>Hmm, this approach isn't obvious.</p>\n",
       "<p>But wait, let's think. Suppose we sort the points in lex order (x, then y, then z). Now, for each consecutive pair (i, i+1), their x, y, z are the smallest possible. So their bounding box is the minimal possible. So perhaps any other point in the list is lex order higher than i+1. So their x is &gt;= i+1's x. If the i and i+1's x is the same, then other points with x equal to that may have higher y or z.</p>\n",
       "<p>But then, their bounding box's x is the same. So the other points with same x but higher y or z would have y &gt;= i's y and i+1's y (since sorted). So their y is in the box's y range? Not necessarily. For example, if the pair is (x=5,y=1) and (x=5,y=3), then another point (x=5, y=2) would have y in the range [1,3], thus inside the box.</p>\n",
       "<p>So pairing consecutive points in sorted order may not be valid.</p>\n",
       "<p>So this approach may not work.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternative idea: Find a pair where one point is the minimal in some coordinate and the other is the next minimal in that coordinate. For example, find the two points with the smallest x-coordinate. Then check if their bounding box contains any other points. If not, pair them. Otherwise, find the next minimal pair.</p>\n",
       "<p>But this again requires checking other points, which is O(n^3) time.</p>\n",
       "<p>Hmm. Let's think differently. What's the maximum possible n? 2000. So we need an algorithm that is O(n^2), which would be 4 million operations, acceptable for Python.</p>\n",

       "<p>Point C has x=3 &gt;= 2, so x is outside. So even though y and z are in the range, x is outside. So the box of A and B does not include C.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, for the sorted list, the first and second points' box's x range is [A.x, B.x]. Since the rest of the points are sorted in lex order, their x is &gt;= B.x.

       "<p>Thus, the box of A and B will not have any other points in the x dimension. The y and z dimensions may have ranges, but since the other points have x &gt;= B.x, their x is outside. So even if their y and z are in the box's ranges, they are not in the box.</p>\n",

       "<p>All other points (C) in the list have x &gt;= B.x.</p>\n",
       "<p>Therefore, the x range of the box of A and B is [A.x, B.x]. Any other point C has x &gt;= B.x, so C.x &gt;= B.x &gt;= A.x. Therefore, C.x is outside the box's x range (since it's &gt;= B.x, which is the max of A.x and B.x). So C's x is not in the box's x range. Thus, C cannot be in the box of A and B.</p>\n",
       "<p>Therefore, consecutive pairs in the sorted list (sorted by x, then y, then z) will have boxes that do not contain any other points.</p>\n",
       "<p>This is a crucial observation.</p>\n",
       "<p>Thus, the algorithm is:</p>\n",
       "<p>Sort the points in lex order (x, then y, then z).</p>\n",
       "<p>Pair consecutive points in this order: (1,2), (3,4), etc.</p>\n",
       "<p>This way, each pair's box does not include any other points.</p>\n",
       "<p>Because for any pair (A, B), all other points have x &gt;= B.x. Therefore, their x is outside the box's x range. So the other points cannot be in the box. Thus, the pair is valid.</p>\n",
       "<p>Therefore, this approach will work.</p>\n",
       "<p>This is the correct solution.</p>\n",
       "<p>Let me verify this with the sample inputs.</p>\n",
       "<p>First sample input:</p>\n",
       "<p>6 points.</p>\n",
       "<p>After sorting lex order (x, then y, then z), the order would be:</p>\n",
       "<p>6 (0,1,0)</p>\n",
       "<p>2 (0,3,0)</p>\n",
       "<p>4 (1,0,0)</p>\n",
       "<p>5 (1,3,0)</p>\n",
       "<p>3 (2,2,0)</p>\n",
       "<p>1 (3,1,0)</p>\n",
       "<p>Consecutive pairs:</p>\n",
       "<p>6 &amp; 2, 4 &amp;5, 3 &amp;1.</p>\n",
       "<p>Check if their boxes contain any other points.</p>\n",
       "<p>For 6 and 2: x ranges from 0 to 0 (since both have x=0). So other points have x &gt;=0, but &gt;=0. So other points' x is &gt;=0. But since the max x is 0, the other points (4,5,3,1) have x &gt;=1, which is outside. So their x is outside. So the box's x is 0. So the other points' x is outside. Thus, no points are in the box.</p>\n",
       "<p>For 4 and5: x is 1 and 1. So the x range is 1. Other points (3,1) have x &gt;=2. So their x is outside. So box is valid.</p>\n",
       "<p>For 3 and1: x is 2 and 3. Other points are already removed. So valid.</p>\n",
       "<p>Thus, the pairs are valid.</p>\n",
       "<p>But the sample's first pair is 3 and6, which is not consecutive in this sorted list. So why does the sample output have a different order?</p>\n",
       "<p>Because the problem allows any valid sequence. The sample's solution is valid, but the approach of pairing consecutive points in sorted order is also valid.</p>\n",
       "<p>Thus, the solution is to sort the points lex order and pair them consecutively.</p>\n",
       "<p>This approach is O(n log n) for sorting and O(n) for pairing, which is efficient.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, the steps are:</p>\n",
       "<p>Sort the points in lex order (x, then y, then z).</p>\n",
       "<p>Pair the first and second, third and fourth, etc.</p>\n",
       "<p>Each pair's box will not include any other points, because other points have x &gt;= the second point's x, which is &gt;= the first point's x. Thus, their x is outside the box's x range.</p>\n",
       "<p>Therefore, this is the correct solution.</p>\n",
       "<p>Now, implement this in Python.</p>\n",
       "<p>To do this:</p>\n",
       "<p>Read n.</p>\n",
       "<p>Read n points, storing their indices (since the output requires the original indices).</p>\n",
       "<p>Sort the points lex order (x, y, z).</p>\n",
       "<p>Pair consecutive pairs.</p>\n",
       "<p>Output the indices of each pair.</p>\n",
       "<p>Yes. So this is the solution.\n",

       "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.</p>\n",
       "<p>The problem is about finding the maximum possible size k of array b, where each element of b is a strongly composite number. The product of all elements in a must equal the product of all elements in b. So, the task is to factor the product of a's elements into as many as possible factors that are strongly composite.</p>\n",
       "<p>First, let's understand what a strongly composite number is. A strongly composite number is a composite number where the count of prime divisors is less than or equal to the count of composite divisors. Wait, the divisors of v are the numbers that divide v. For example, 12 has divisors {1,2,3,4,6,12}. Among these, primes are 2 and 3 (two primes), composites are 4,6,12 (three composites). So primes count is 2, composites count 3. Since 2 &lt;=3, 12 is strongly composite.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, the key is to split the product into factors where each factor meets this condition.</p>\n",
       "<p>My approach should be to factorize the product into primes, then group these primes into factors that are strongly composite. The goal is to maximize the number of such factors.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, first step: factorize the product of all a_i into their prime factors. Then, we need to determine how to split these primes into groups such that each group forms a number that is strongly composite.</p>\n",
       "<p>The problem reduces to grouping the exponents of the prime factors in such a way that each group (which forms a composite number) meets the strongly composite condition.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, the main challenge is to model the conditions for a number being strongly composite based on its prime factors.</p>\n",
       "<p>Let's think about the prime factors of a number v. Let's suppose v's prime factors are p1^e1 * p2^e2 * ... * pn^en. The number of divisors of v is (e1+1)<em>(e2+1)</em>...*(en+1). But for a number to be composite, it must have more than two divisors. So, the primes in v's prime factors must contribute to a composite number. Wait, but even a prime squared (like 4=2^2) is composite.</p>\n",
       "<p>But for a number to be composite, it just needs to not be a prime. So, the factors of v (the elements of b) must be composite numbers, which is ensured because all elements of b are required to be greater than 1 and strongly composite (which are composite by definition).</p>\n",
       "<p>But each element in b must be strongly composite. So, each such element must be a composite number, and in its set of divisors (excluding 1 and itself?), wait no. The problem says divisors include all numbers that divide v. So, for v to be composite, it must have more than two divisors, which is already covered by being composite.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, the problem states that a composite number is one that has more than two different divisors. So, for example, 4 is composite, since its divisors are 1, 2, 4. So, three divisors. So yes.</p>\n",
       "<p>But the key is to ensure that for each element in b, when you look at all its divisors (including 1 and the number itself), the number of prime divisors is &lt;= the number of composite divisors.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but the divisors include 1 and the number itself. For example, take 4. Divisors are 1, 2, 4. Prime divisors are 2 (only one). Composite divisors are 4 (only one). So primes count is 1, composite count 1. So 1 &lt;=1. So 4 is strongly composite. So, yes.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another example: 6. Divisors are 1,2,3,6. Prime divisors: 2,3 (count 2). Composite divisors:6 (count 1). So primes count is 2, composite is 1. So 2&gt;1. So 6 is not a strongly composite. So even though 6 is composite, it's not strongly composite.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, how can we model the conditions for a number to be strongly composite based on its prime factors?</p>\n",
       "<p>Hmm. Let's think about the prime factors of a number and their exponents. Let's take a number v. Let's say the prime factors of v are such that when we compute the count of prime and composite divisors of v, the primes (in the divisors) are those divisors of v that are primes, and the composite divisors are those that are composite.</p>\n",
       "<p>For example, take v=12. The divisors are 1,2,3,4,6,12. Prime divisors: 2 and 3 (count 2). Composite divisors: 4,6,12 (count 3). So 2&lt;=3, so yes.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to model this for a general v.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternative approach: For a number v to be strongly composite, the number of prime divisors (in its list of divisors) must be &lt;= the number of composite divisors.</p>\n",
       "<p>Let me think about the divisors of v. Let's exclude 1 and v itself. Then, the number of prime divisors (primes in the list of divisors) and composite divisors (composites in the list) must satisfy primes &lt;= composites.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but the original problem counts all divisors except 1 and v? Or includes them?</p>\n",
       "<p>The problem statement's examples include 1 and the number itself. For example, 12's divisors include 1 and 12. So in the example, the prime divisors are 2,3 (count 2), composite divisors are 4,6,12 (count 3). So yes.</p>\n",
       "<p>So for a number v, the set of divisors includes 1 and v. But 1 is not considered prime or composite. So for the problem's condition, the primes in the divisors are primes greater than 1, and composite divisors are composites (which must be greater than 1 as well).</p>\n",
       "<p>So, for a given v (which is composite), how many of its divisors are primes (p) where p divides v and p is prime, and how many are composites (c) where c divides v and c is composite.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, the count for primes in the divisors of v is the number of distinct prime factors of v, right?</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, no. For example, 4 has divisors 1,2,4. The primes in the divisors are 2. So count is 1. The composite divisors are 4. So count 1. So 1&lt;=1: 4 is strongly composite.</p>\n",
       "<p>But the prime factors of 4 are 2^2. The distinct primes are 1. So yes, the primes in the divisors are exactly the distinct primes of v.</p>\n",
       "<p>But for 12, the primes in the divisors are 2 and 3. Which are exactly the distinct primes in the factorization. So the number of primes in the divisors is the number of distinct primes in the factorization of v.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, for v to be strongly composite, the number of distinct primes in its factorization (let's call this s) must be &lt;= (number of composite divisors).</p>\n",
       "<p>But the composite divisors are the divisors of v that are composite numbers. So how many composite divisors are there?</p>\n",
       "<p>The total number of divisors (including 1 and v) is (e1+1)(e2+1)...(en+1), where e_i are exponents. The primes in the divisors are the primes in the factorization. The composite divisors are the divisors that are composite (i.e., divisors &gt;1 and not primes). So composite divisors = total divisors (excluding 1 and v) - primes.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, let's see:</p>\n",
       "<p>For a given v:</p>\n",
       "<p>Total divisors (including 1 and v) is T = product (e_i +1).</p>\n",
       "<p>Subtract 1 (for divisor 1) and 1 (for divisor v if it is a prime). Wait, no. Because v is a composite number (since it's in array b), so v is composite, which implies it's not a prime. So divisor v is composite. So:</p>\n",
       "<p>The divisors are:</p>\n",
       "<p>1 (not prime or composite)</p>\n",
       "<p>prime divisors: the primes in the prime factors (each prime p that divides v is a divisor of v).</p>\n",
       "<p>composite divisors: the divisors that are composite (including v itself).</p>\n",
       "<p>So, the count of prime divisors is s (the number of distinct primes in v's factorization).</p>\n",
       "<p>The count of composite divisors is (T - 1 - s) because:</p>\n",
       "<p>Total divisors (including 1, primes, composites) = T.</p>\n",
       "<p>Subtract 1 (the divisor 1) and s (the primes) gives the number of composite divisors.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, the condition for v being strongly composite is:</p>\n",
       "<p>s &lt;= (T -1 - s)</p>\n",
       "<p>Which simplifies to:</p>\n",
       "<p>2s &lt;= T -1</p>\n",
       "<p>So, 2s +1 &lt;= T.</p>\n",
       "<p>But T is the total number of divisors (including 1 and v). So, for example:</p>\n",
       "<p>v =4: T is 3 (divisors 1,2,4). s=1. So 2*1 +1=3 &lt;=3 → yes. So condition holds.</p>\n",
       "<p>v=12: T=6. s=2. 2*2 +1=5 &lt;=6 → yes. 5&lt;=6 → yes.</p>\n",
       "<p>v=6: T=4. s=2. 2*2 +1=5 &lt;=4 → no. So condition fails. So 6 is not strongly composite.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, the condition is 2s +1 &lt;= T, where s is the number of distinct primes in v's factorization, and T is the total number of divisors of v.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, to model whether a number v (which is composite) is strongly composite, we need to check if 2s +1 &lt;= T.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how to model this for the given problem.</p>\n",
       "<p>The problem requires that each element in array b is a strongly composite number. So, when we split the product into factors, each factor must satisfy the condition 2s_i +1 &lt;= T_i, where s_i is the number of distinct primes in the factor's prime decomposition, and T_i is the total number of divisors of that factor.</p>\n",
       "<p>But since each factor is part of the product, their prime factors are a subset of the overall prime factors of the product.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, the approach is to factorize the product into primes, then group the primes and their exponents into factors such that each factor meets the condition 2s_i +1 &lt;= T_i, and we want to maximize the number of such factors.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, the problem reduces to grouping the primes into factors (each factor can have primes and exponents) such that each factor is a strongly composite number, and the product of all factors equals the original product.</p>\n",
       "<p>The goal is to split the primes into as many such groups as possible.</p>\n",
       "<p>Now, the challenge is to model this grouping in a way that allows us to compute the maximum possible k.</p>\n",
       "<p>But how?</p>\n",
       "<p>Let's think about the minimal conditions for a factor to be strongly composite.</p>\n",
       "<p>Let's start with examples of numbers that are strongly composite:</p>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>4 (2^2): s=1, T=3. 2*1 +1=3 ≤3 → yes.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<p>So 4 is good. So any factor that is a square of a prime can be a group.</p>\n",
       "<p>Similarly, 9 (3^2): s=1, T=3 → yes.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another example is 8 (2^3): T=4 divisors. s=1. 2*1 +1=3 ≤4 → yes. So 8 is strongly composite.</p>\n",
       "<p>What about 12 (2^2 <em>3^1): T=(2+1)</em>(1+1)=6. s=2. 2*2 +1=5 ≤6 → yes.</p>\n",
       "<p>So 12 is good.</p>\n",
       "<p>What about 6 (2*3): T=4, s=2 → 5 ≤4 → no. So 6 is not allowed.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, factors that are the product of two different primes (each exponent 1) would not be allowed. But if a factor has exponents higher than 1, maybe it can be allowed.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, the idea is that factors which are squares of primes, or products of primes with higher exponents, can be allowed.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, perhaps the way to maximize k is to split the primes into as many squares as possible. Because a square of a prime (like 4) can be a single factor (counts as 1 in k) and each such square is a valid strongly composite.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, for example, if a prime p has exponent 2 in the product, then we can split it into p^2, which is a square and counts as one factor. If the exponent is higher, say 3, then we can split into p^2 and p^1, but the p^1 can't form a composite on its own (since it's a prime). Wait, but we need all factors in b to be composite. So, any individual prime in b is invalid, so all elements in b must be composite.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, the factors must be composite, which implies that each factor must be a product of primes with exponents such that the product is at least 2. So, primes can't be factors. So, each factor must have at least two primes (but not necessarily, since even a single prime squared is composite).</p>\n",
       "<p>So, in order to split the primes into as many groups as possible, perhaps the optimal way is to split each prime into as many squares as possible, because each square (like 4) counts as one factor, and each cube can be split into a square and a cube divided by the square (but not sure). Wait, but 8 is 2^3. Its divisors are 1,2,4,8. s=1 (only 2 is a prime divisor). T=4. So 2*1+1=3 &lt;=4. So 8 is allowed. So a single cube of a prime can be a factor.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, exponents can be 2 or 3, etc., as long as the condition holds.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, the key is that each group (factor) must be a composite number (so, not a single prime) and satisfy 2s +1 &lt;= T.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, let's model this.</p>\n",
       "<p>First, factor the product into primes. Let's say the prime factors are a multiset with their exponents. For example, if the product is 2^5 <em>3^3 </em>5^1, then the exponents are 5,3,1 for primes 2,3,5.</p>\n",
       "<p>But the problem is that when grouping, we can't split the exponents of a prime across groups. For example, if a prime has exponent 5, and we split it into groups that use exponents 2,2,1. Then, the 2 exponents can form two squares (each 2^2, which is allowed), but the 1 exponent can't form a group by itself (since 2^1 is a prime). So, the 1 exponent would have to be combined with exponents from other primes.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, maybe the 5 exponents can be split into 3 and 2: 2^3 is allowed (since 8 is allowed) and 2^2 is allowed (4). So, 2 groups.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, the strategy for each prime's exponents is to split them into as many as possible groups where each group's exponent is &gt;=2. Because exponents &gt;=2 allow the prime to be part of a group that's a square or higher.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, but if a group consists of a single prime squared (like 4), that's allowed. If a group consists of multiple primes, each with exponent 1, then their product would be a square-free composite. For example, 2*3=6. But 6 is composite, but not strongly composite. Because in the divisors of 6, there are two primes (2 and 3), and one composite (6). So primes count is 2, composite is 1. So 2&gt;1 → not allowed. So such a group would not be valid.</p>\n",
       "<p>Therefore, groups that consist of multiple primes with exponents 1 are not allowed. So, the only way to form a group with multiple primes is if at least one of them has an exponent &gt;=2, such that the group's condition holds.</p>\n",
       "<p>But this complicates things. So perhaps the optimal way is to split the primes into groups where each group is a single prime with exponent &gt;=2. Because each such group contributes 1 to k, and maximizes k.</p>\n",
       "<p>But perhaps there's a case where combining primes into a group allows a higher k. For example, if a group uses two primes with exponents 1 each, but combining them with another prime's exponents. Wait, but that's tricky.</p>\n",
       "<p>Alternatively, let's think about the following: the maximum possible k is determined by how many \"squares\" we can form. Because each square (exponent &gt;=2 of a single prime) gives one group. For exponents &gt;=2, we can split them into as many squares as possible.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, for a prime p with exponent e:</p>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Each group for p can take 2 exponents (like forming p^2). So the number of groups from p is floor(e / 2). But the remaining exponents (e mod 2) can be 0 or 1. If it's 1, then that 1 exponent can't form a group on its own. So, perhaps those remaining exponents can be combined with other primes' exponents.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<p>But how?</p>\n",
       "<p>For example, if we have primes p and q with exponents 3 and 3:</p>\n",
       "<p>p's exponents can be split into 2 groups of 2 (but 3 is odd, so 3//2=1, leaving 1).</p>\n",
       "<p>Similarly for q. So, remaining exponents are 1 each.</p>\n",
       "<p>If we combine those 1 exponents into a group p*q, but that's 2 primes with exponents 1 each. As discussed before, this group is 6, which is composite but not strongly composite. So that group would be invalid.</p>\n",
       "<p>But if we have three primes with one exponent each left, can we combine them into p<em>q</em>r, which would be a composite. Let's check:</p>\n",
       "<p>Take v=30=2<em>3</em>5. Its divisors are 1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30. Primes in divisors are 2,3,5 (count 3). Composite divisors are 6,10,15,30 (count 4). So 3 &lt;=4 → yes. So 30 is strongly composite.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, in this case, a group of three distinct primes with exponents 1 each is allowed. Because the s (number of distinct primes) is 3, T (total divisors) is (1+1)(1+1)(1+1) =8. So, T=8. The condition is 2*3 +1=7 &lt;=8 → yes. So 30 is allowed.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, such a group is allowed.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, in this case, combining three primes with exponent 1 each into a group gives a valid factor, contributing 1 to k, which is better than not using those exponents at all.</p>\n",
       "<p>Therefore, the strategy would be:</p>\n",
       "<ol>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>For each prime, split its exponents into as many groups of 2 exponents (i.e., squares) as possible. Each such group contributes 1 to k. The remaining exponents (0 or 1 per prime) can be saved.</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>Then, collect all the remaining exponents (which are 1 per prime) and try to form groups of three primes. Each group of three contributes 1 to k. Any leftover primes (less than three) can't form a group.</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "</ol>\n",
       "<p>So, the maximum k is the sum of floor(e_i / 2) for all primes, plus the number of triples formed from the remaining 1 exponents.</p>\n",
       "<p>But wait, the floor(e_i /2) gives the number of squares (each contributing 1 to k). Then, the remaining exponents (counted as the number of primes with an odd exponent) is the number of primes that have a remaining exponent of 1. Then, the number of triples is floor( (total_remaining) /3 ). Each triple contributes 1 to k.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the total k is:</p>\n",
       "<p>sum (e_i // 2) + (number_of_remaining_primes) //3</p>\n",
       "<p>But how?</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, let's take an example.</p>\n",
       "<p>Example 1: Primes 2^5, 3^3, 5^1.</p>\n",
       "<p>Processing each prime:</p>\n",
       "<p>2: 5 //2 = 2 groups (each of 2 exponents), remaining exponent 1.</p>\n",
       "<p>3: 3//2=1 group, remaining 1.</p>\n",
       "<p>5: 1//2=0, remaining 1.</p>\n",
       "<p>Total remaining primes: 3 (2,3,5 each have 1 exponent left).</p>\n",
       "<p>These can form one triple (3 primes), contributing 1. So total k is 2+1 +1 =4.</p>\n",
       "<p>But wait, in this case, the sum of e_i//2 is 2+1+0=3. Then, remaining is 3 primes, which can form 1 triple, adding 1. So total k=3+1=4.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another example:</p>\n",
       "<p>Primes 2^3, 3^1, 5^1.</p>\n",
       "<p>sum(e//2) is 3//2=1 for 2, and 0 for 3 and 5. Sum is 1. Remaining exponents: 1 (from 2) +1 (3) +1 (5) =3 → can form 1 triple. So total k=1+1=2.</p>\n",
       "<p>But wait, 2^3 gives one group (exponent 2, forming 4) and leaves 1. Then, the remaining 1 exponents in 2, 3,5 can form a triple (2<em>3</em>5=30), which is allowed. So k=2.</p>\n",
       "<p>So this approach seems correct.</p>\n",
       "<p>But what if the remaining primes are more than 3? For example, 4 primes left. Then, they can form 1 triple (3 primes), leaving 1 prime. But that one can't form anything.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, the formula is sum (e_i//2) + (remaining_primes) //3.</p>\n",
       "<p>Yes.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the steps are:</p>\n",
       "<ol>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>Factorize the product of all a_i into primes and their exponents.</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>For each prime, compute the number of squares possible: e_i // 2. Sum these to get the initial k.</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>For each prime, check if e_i is odd. If so, add 1 to the count of remaining primes (since we have 1 exponent left).</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>Then, the number of additional groups is the (remaining_primes) //3.</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>The total k is the sum from step 2 plus the result from step 4.</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "</ol>\n",
       "<p>But wait, is that correct? Because in some cases, combining the remaining primes may not be possible.</p>\n",
       "<p>Wait, the remaining primes each have 1 exponent left, so when you group three of them, the product is p<em>q</em>r, which is allowed as a strongly composite. As in the example of 30.</p>\n",
       "<p>But what about two primes left?</p>\n",
       "<p>For example, two primes: 2 and 3. The product is 6. Which is composite but not strongly composite. Because divisors are 1,2,3,6. primes count is 2 (2 and3), composite count is 1 (6). So 2&gt;1 → not allowed. So grouping two primes is not allowed.</p>\n",
       "<p>Similarly, four primes left: can form one triple (3 primes) and one left. But that left can't form a group.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, the approach of adding (remaining_primes) //3 is correct.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, the algorithm is:</p>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>Compute all primes in the product of a_i, with their total exponents.</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>For each prime's exponent, add e_i //2 to the total groups.</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>Count how many primes have an odd exponent (e_i % 2 ==1). Let this be 'remaining'.</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>Add remaining //3 to the total groups.</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<p>But wait, what about exponents that are more than 2 but even?</p>\n",
       "<p>For example, e_i=4: 4//2=2 groups. So that's two squares. So for a prime p with exponent 4, it's split into p^2 and p^2. Both are allowed, contributing 2 groups.</p>\n",
       "<p>Yes.</p>\n",
       "<p>Now, what about the case where after splitting into squares and triples, but some primes are left (like two primes left). Can they be used in any way?</p>\n",
       "<p>No, because grouping them would form a product that is not allowed.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, the maximum possible k is sum (e_i//2) + (number of primes with odd exponents) //3.</p>\n",
       "<p>But this is under the assumption that each group formed by three primes contributes 1 to k, and that's the only way to use up the remaining exponents.</p>\n",
       "<p>But what about when a prime has e_i &gt;=3. For example, e_i=3. Then e_i//2 is 1 (since 3//2=1), leaving 1. But what if instead of taking 2 exponents (to form a square) and leaving 1, perhaps it's better to take 3 exponents to form a cube (which is allowed). For example, p^3. Let's see:</p>\n",
       "<p>p^3 has exponents: s=1 (number of primes in its factors). T is (3+1) =4 divisors. So 2*1 +1=3 &lt;=4 → allowed. So, p^3 is a valid group.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, for e_i=3, we can split into a cube (exponent 3) which counts as one group, leaving 0 exponents. So for e_i=3, splitting into a cube gives 1 group, but splitting into a square (exponent 2) and leaving 1 exponent would contribute 1 group (from the square) and leave 1 exponent. But then, when considering the remaining exponents, the 1 would be part of the 'remaining' count. So if there are other primes with remaining exponents, maybe forming a triple is possible.</p>\n",
       "<p>But which approach gives a higher k?</p>\n",
       "<p>For example, e_i=3:</p>\n",
       "<p>Option 1: take e_i//2=1 group (exponent 2) and leave 1. Then, if the remaining can form a triple, that's +1. So total groups from this prime: 1 +1 (if triple is formed).</p>\n",
       "<p>But if we take the cube (exponent 3), we get 1 group, and nothing left.</p>\n",
       "<p>But in option 1, the 1 exponent left may or may not contribute to a triple. So, which is better?</p>\n",
       "<p>Case 1: If there are other primes with 1 exponents.</p>\n",
       "<p>Suppose we have two primes, each with e_i=3.</p>\n",
       "<p>Option 1: split each into 1 group (square), leaving 1 exponent each. Total groups from squares: 2. Remaining: 2. These can't form a triple. So total k=2.</p>\n",
       "<p>Option 2: split each into a cube. Total groups: 2. So same as option1.</p>\n",
       "<p>But if there are three primes each with e_i=3.</p>\n",
       "<p>Option1: split into squares (each contributes 1 group, total 3), leaving 3 exponents. These can form one triple. So total 3+1=4.</p>\n",
       "<p>Option2: split into cubes (each contributes 1 group, total 3 groups). So same as 3. So option1 is better.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, in this case, splitting into squares and then forming a triple gives a better result.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, the strategy of taking as many squares as possible and then forming triples from the remaining exponents is better.</p>\n",
       "<p>So, the initial approach (sum of e_i//2 plus remaining//3) is better.</p>\n",
       "<p>Therefore, the algorithm is correct.</p>\n",
       "<p>But wait, let's check this with the example given in the problem.</p>\n",

       "<p>Wait, no. If all exponents are even, then e_i//2 for each is at least 1 (if e_i is 2). So sum_squares would be sum (e_i//2) &gt;= sum(1 for each e_i &gt;=2). So, unless there are no primes (which is impossible since product is 1, but a_i &gt;=2), sum_squares must be &gt;=1.</p>\n",

       "<p>Which is correct.</p>\n",
       "<p>So the code's logic is:</p>\n",
